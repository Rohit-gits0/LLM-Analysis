"1.1 Dhritarashtra said  What did my people and the sons of Pandu do when they had assembled
together eager for battle on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya.","1 And the king said, O Sanjay, what did I and the sons of Pandou do, those who were willing to fight, which were gathered in the kingdom of Kurushtra?"
"1.2. Sanjaya said  Having seen the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle-array,
King Duryodhana then approached his teacher (Drona) and spoke these words.","1.2 Sanjay said, “When the king Duriodhan saw the pandov army’s voyo composition, he went to the adjacent drown and said these words."
"1.3. ""Behold, O Teacher! this mighty army of the sons of Pandu,
arrayed by the son of Drupada, thy wise disciple.","1.3.O Acara! see this precious army of the Pandu sons, which was established by your wise disciple Drupad-Son (Dhrihtad-Dhuman)."

and Arjuna, Yoyudhana (Satyaki), Virata and Drupada, of the great car (mighty
warriors).","1.4 In this army there are great-righteous shur warriors, who in war are similar to dham and arjun, such as - youth, virat and maarthi king Dropad."

who are the most distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army;
these I name to thee for thy information.",You also know those special warriors which are on our behalf; for your information I tell you the names of the heroes of my army.
"1.8. ""Thyself and Bhishma, and Karna and also Kripa, the victorious
in war, Asvatthama, Vikarna, and also Bhurisrava, the son of Somadatta.","1.8.1 So you are the son of you, the inner, the karn, and the victorious of war, the graceful and the ashvathama, the wickern and the sunset."

lives for my sake, armed with various weapons and missiles, all well-skilled
in battle.","I am ready to give up my soul, equipped with many kinds of weapons and skillful in war and even many shur heroes."
"1.10. ""This army of ours marshalled by Bhishma is insufficient,
whereas that army of theirs marshelled by Bhima is sufficient.","1.10 Our army protected by the earth is insufficient; but their army protected by the earth is sufficient, or our army protected by the earth is unlimited, but their army protected by the earth is unlimited."
"1.11. ""Therefore do ye all, stationed in your respective positions,
in the several divisions of the army, protect Bhishma alone.""","1.11 While staying in your place on various fronts, protect all of you from all sides of the Father."
"1.12. His glorious grandsire (Bhishma), the oldest of the Kauravas,
in order to cheer Duryodhana, now roared like a lion, and blew his conch.","1.12 At that time, the elders of the curves, the praiseful Father, was in the hearts of that (Duryoed) in a loud tone, and praised and praised."
"1.13. Then (following Bhishma), conches and kettledrums, tabors,
drums and cow horns blared forth ite suddenly (from the Kaurava side)
and the sound was tremendous.","1.13.Tatpashtshang, towns, shol and shrangi etc. instruments stood up together, whose great terrible words occurred."
"1.14. Then, also, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna),
seated in the magnificent chariot, yoked with white horses, blew divine
conches.","1.14 In his subnight white ashes, in the great roat sitting Madhv (Shriकृष्ण) and Panduputra Arjuna also played his divine shang."
"1.15. Hrishikesha blew the Panchajanya and Arjuna blew the Devadatta
and Bhima (the wolf-bellied), the doer of terrible deeds, blew the great
conch Paundra.","1.15 The Lord of the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers, and the Fathers."

the son of Subhadra, the mighty-armed, blew their conches separately.","1:18 O Rajan, the king Drupad, the son of Drupadi, and Mahabahu Saubrat, all of them played different shank."
"1.19. That tumultuous sound rent the hearts of (the members of)
Dhritarashtra's party, making both the heaven and the earth resound.","1:19 And he began to clarify greatly on heaven and on earth, and he distorted the hearts of the sons of the land."
"1.20. Then, seeing the people of Dhritarashtra’s party standing
arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of
Pandu, whose ensign was a monkey, took up his bow and said the following
to Krishna, O Lord of the earth.","1:20 So when the war was to begin, the captain Arjuna saw the sons of the land, and he raised the arrow, and said these words to the Lord."
"1.21 Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.","21 And Arjuna said, Oh, put my wheat in the midst of the two armies."
"1.22. Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.",1.22. by which I can stand with the will of war and observe these people with whom I have to fight in this war.
"1.23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight,
wishing to please in battle the evil-minded Duryodhana (the son of Dhritarashtra).",1:23 I will see those who will fight in the battle of the beloved Dharta (Dharta) who these kings have gathered here.
"1.24. Sanjaya said  Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna, having stationed that
best of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies.","1.24 Sanjay said, “O India (three countries)!When Arjuna said this way, Godhashikesh stood the best rath between the two armies."
"1.25. In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the
earth, said: ""O Arjuna (son of Pritha), behold these Kurus gathered together.""","1:25 And they said before the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth, and the ruler of the earth."
"1.26. Then, Arjuna (son of Pritha) saw there (in the armies) stationed,
fathers and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons
and friends too.","26 There Arjuna also saw the brothers of the Father standing in those two armies, the fathers, the affairs, the affairs, the brothers, the sons, the Puthers, the friends, the shepherds and the hearts."
"1.27. (He saw) fathers-in-law and friends also in both the armies.
The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those kinsmen thus standing arrayed,
spoke this, sorrowfully filled with deep pity.","1:27 So when he saw all those bonds standing, the heart of the Kanti son Arjuna was filled with mercy, and he was poisoned and said this."
"1.28. Arjuna said  Seeing these, my kinsmen, O krishna, arrayed, eager to fight.","1.28 1.29 Arjuna said, “O Kṛṣṇa, present with the will of war, seeing these selfishs, my organs are shitelled, my mouth is also drying, and in my body is compounding and exciting."
"1.29. My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body ivers and
my hair stands on end.","1.28 1.29 Arjuna said, “O Kṛṣṇa, present with the will of war, seeing these selfishs, my organs are shitelled, my mouth is also drying, and in my body is compounding and adventure."
"1.30. The (bow) Gandiva slips from my hand, and also my skins burns
all over; I am unable even to stand and my mind is reeling, as it were.","1:30 And from my hand falls guns and the skin burns; my mind becomes somewhat confused, and I cannot stand."
"1.31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava. I do not see any good
in killing my kinsmen in battle.","1.31 O Keshov, I also see the victims in the contrary, and I do not see any goodness in the battle, by killing my neighbors."
"1.32. I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.
Of what avail is dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?","1:32 O Krishna, I do not want victory, nor kingdom, nor pleasures, O Govind, what is the purpose of us from kingdom or from food and from living?"
"1.33. Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,
stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.","1.33 Those among us for whom the desire of kingdom, the desire and the desire of prosperity, are the ones who stand in war, abandoning the hope of wealth and life."
"1.34. Teachers, fathers, sons and also grandfathers, maternal uncles,
fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives,-","1:34.They are Gourozan, Tao, Uncle, Son, Father, Swazur, Uncle, Shilak and others related."
"1.35. These I do not wish to kill, though they kill me, O Krishna,
even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds; leave alone killing
them for the sake of the earth.","I do not want to kill them for their killing me or for the kingdom of the trio, then what is to say for the earth?"
"1.36. By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can
be ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue to us from killing these felons.","1.36 O generade, what will we be pleased by killing the sons of the land? by killing these atheists we will only have sin."
"1.37. Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra,
our relatives; for how can we be happy by killing our own people, O Madhava
(Krishna)?","1:37 So it is not worthy for us to kill the sons of our bonded land, for how happy will we be by killing the selfish ones."
"1.38. Though they, with intelligence overpowered by greed, see
no evil in the destruction of families, and no sin in hostility to friends,","1.38 Though corrupted by lust, these people do not see sin in corrupted fault and friendship."
"1.39. Why should not we who clearly see evil in the destruction
of families, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana (Krishna)?","1.39 But, o Gentleman, why should not we, who know the fault that occurs from the holocaust, think to refuse this sin?"
"1.40. In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious
rites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety,
indeed, overcomes the whole family.",1.40 The destruction of the whole is the destruction of the whole religion; the destruction of the whole religion is the destruction of the whole religion.
"1.41. By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of
the family become corrupt; and , women being corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant
of Vrishni), there arises intermingling of castes.",1.41.....................
"1.42. Confusion of castes leads to hell the slayers of the family,
for their forefathers fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-ball and
water (libations).","1.42 It causes the character to bring the curtains and the whole to hell.They's fathers, deprived of the action of pine and water, also fall into hell."
"1.43. By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which
cause confusion of castes, the eternal religious rites of the caste and
the family are destroyed.",.1.43.These characteristic factors defects cause mutual defects to destroy all-inclusive mutuality and ethnicity.
"1.44. We have heard, O Janardana, that inevitable is the dwelling
for an unknown period in hell for those men in whose families the religious
practices have been destroyed.",We have heard that those of whom the whole religion is destroyed will live in hell for unjust time.
"1.45. Alas! We are involved in a great sin, in that we are
prepared to kill our kinsmen, through greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.","1.45 Oh, it is sad that we are determined to commit a great sin, who are prepared to destroy our families by the praise of this kingdom."
"1.46. If the sons of Dhritarashtra with weapons in hand should
slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.","1.46 If these armed men kill the one who has no weapons and does not reject me in pride, then he will be good for me."
"1.47. Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna,
casting away his bow and arrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot with
his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.","17:17 And he said unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them, Thou shalt say unto them."
"2.1 Sanjaya said  To him who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, Madhusudana (the destroyer of Madhu) or Krishna spoke these words.","Sanjay said — thus this sentence was said by Akul Arjun from Medusudan, who was overwhelmed by mercy and toxicity, with unfulfilled eyes."
"2.2 The Blessed Lord said  Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of you, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon you, O Arjuna?","2 And the Lord said, O Arjuna, where did this moh come from you in this untouchable place? this, contrary to the Arya behavior, is neither a means of heavenly achievement nor a means of charity."
"2.3 Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha. It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean weakness of the heart! Stand up, O scorcher of the foes!",2.3.Do not be parathy; it is untouchable to you; but stand up and give up the weakness of your heart.
"2.4 Arjuna said  How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?","2:4 And Arjuna said, O Medusudan, how will I fight against the bonds in the land of the land of the land of the land of the land of the land of the land of the land?"
"2.5 Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires will be stained with (their) blood.","To take the food of worship in this people is more well-being than to kill these great-righteous guards, for by killing guards I will only feed the bloodshed meaning and work-form guards in this people."
"2.6 I can hardly tell which will be better, that we should  coner them or that they should coner us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us.","We do not know what it is right for us to do; we do not even know that we will win, or they will win us, whom we do not want to survive by killing, they are the sons of the nation who stand for war before us."
2.7 My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity; my mind is confused as to duty. I ask Thee: Tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who has taken refuge in Thee.,"I ask you, overwhelmed by compassion and confused with duty, that you say to him who is great for me, for I am your disciple; you who come in refuge, preach me."
"2.8 I do not see that it would remove this sorrow that burns up my senses, even if I should attain prosperous and unrivalled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods.","Even when I have obtained the untouchable wealthy kingdom on earth and the possession of the gods, I do not see the measure that can remove this sadness that drows my minds."
"2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the coneror of sleep), the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna, ""I will not fight"" and became silent.","Sanjay said—this way Godakesh was silent by saying to Arjuna Godhashikesh, “Govind, I will not fight.”"
"2.10 To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Krishna, as if smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words.","2.10.O India! between the two armies, to that shokmagn Arjuna, God had laughed and said this word."
"2.11 The Blessed Lord said  Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.","The Lord said, ""For those for whom it is not right to regret, you regret and speak words to the wise, but the wise men do not regret for both the dead and the living."""
"2.12 Nor at any time indeed was I not, nor thou, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease to be hereafter.","Indeed, it is not that I was not in any time, or you were not, or these were not royals, and it is not that we will not all be ahead of it."
"2.13 Just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does it pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat.","2.13 As in this body is the comar of the godly victory, youth and aging, so it has the achievement of another body; thin man is not engaged in it."
"2.14 The contacts of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold, pleasure and pain, have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna.","The beginning and end of the coincidence of intelligence and subjects that give cold and warm and pleasant suffering is the beginning and end; they are infinite, therefore, O India, tolerate them."
"2.15 That firm man whom, surely, these afflict not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality.","2.15 O best men, whoever lives with equal sense in sadness and pleasure, whoever can not afflict this man, is the owner of immortality."
2.16 The unreal hath no being; there is non-being of the real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the Truth (or the seers of the Essence).,2.16 The unreal thing therefore does not exist and the truth is never absent; thus the same theity of these two is seen by theoretical wise men.
"2.17 Know that to be indestructible, by Which all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable.","2.17 You know that thing is immortal, by which this whole world is overwhelmed; no one is capable of destroying this wickedness."
"2.18 These bodies of the embodied Self, Which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore fight, O Arjuna.","2.18 All these bodies of the Spirit have been destroyed, so India, you fight."
"2.19 He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks It is slain, neither of them ï1knowsï1. It slays not, nor is It slain.","Whoever thinks that this spirit is killing, and whoever thinks that it is dead, both do not know, for this spirit neither dies nor is killed."
"2.20 It is not born, nor does It ever die; after having been, It again ceases not to be; unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed.","This spirit neither is born nor dies in any time, nor will it once and again be unformed; this spirit is unclean, intentional, eternal and ancient, even if the body is destroyed, it will not be destroyed."
"2.21 Whosoever knows It to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and inexhaustible, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain?","2.21 O Petar, the man who knows this spirit as immortal, intentionally and unfortunate, how will he die and how will he kill?"
"2.22 Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new.","2.22 As man leaves old clothes and holds other new clothes, so the victory also leaves old bodies and gets other new bodies."
"2.23 Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not.","2.23 This spirit cannot be broken, nor fire can burn it; water cannot moisturize it, and air cannot dry it."
"2.24 This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted, nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and ancient.","2.24 For this spirit is good (not to be cut), untouchable (not to be flattered), accledic (not to be flattered) and untouchable (not to be sucked); it is intangible, everlasting, stable (stable), untouchable and untouchable."
"2.25 This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve.","2.25 This spirit is called unclean, unclean and unclean; therefore it is not appropriate for you to regret knowing it in this way."
"2.26 But even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve.","26 And if you think that the Spirit will be born and dying, then, o great, it is not right for you to regret."
"2.27 For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve.","The death of the born is certain, and the birth of the dead is certain; therefore you should not regret for what is inevitable."
"2.28 Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifested again in their end. What is there to grieve about?","2.28 O India, all beings live in an unlimited state before and after birth and are expressed in the middle. then what is concern or sadness in it?"
"2.29 One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet having heard, none understands It at all.",29 One sees it as a surprise; one says it as a surprise; and another man hears it as a surprise; and then no one hears and does not know.
"2.30 This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is ever indestructible, O Arjuna; therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.","O India, this God’s Spirit is always in the body of all, so it is not appropriate for you to regret for all beings."
"2.31 Further, having regard to thy duty, shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.","2.31 And it is not worthy that you be distracted even when you see self-righteousness, for there is no other charitable duty than the religious war for the evil."
"2.32 Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna! who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself as an open door to heaven.","2.32 And, O Pater, those who have acquired themselves and opened the door to heaven will find such a battle to those who are lucky."
"2.33 But if thou wilt not fight this righteous war, then having abandoned thine own duty and fame, thou shalt incur sin.","33 And if you do not accept this religious war, then you will lose self-righteousness and charity and get sin."
"2.34 People, too, will recount thy everlasting dishonour; and to one who has been honoured, dishonour is worse than death.",34 And all will continue to speak of your long-lasting uncertainty; and for a worthy man the uncertainty is greater than death.
2.35 The great car-warriors will think that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear; and thou wilt be lightly held by them who have thought much of thee.,"2:35 And for those to whom you are very righteous, you will now become untouched, and the righteous will consider you for fear of war."
"2.36 Thy enemies also, cavilling at thy power, will speak many abusive words. What is more painful than this?","Your enemies will say many untouchable words, condemning your sorrows, then what will be more painful than that?"
"2.37 Slain, thou wilt obtain heaven; victorious, thou wilt enjoy the earth; therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight.","37 And when you die in war, you will gain heaven, or you will win the earth, and you will stand up in war, O Israel!"
"2.38 Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shalt not incur sin.","Sukh-du: Ah, equal to profit-hany and jay-prajay, prepare for war; thus you will not be sinful."
"2.39 This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdon concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action.","2:39 O Pharat, you have been called statistical knowledge, and now listen to the knowledge of this (carm) yoga, with which you will be able to destroy the work."
"2.40 In this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm (production of contrary results or transgression). Even a little of this knowledge (even a little practice of this Yoga) protects one from great fear.",2.40 There is no ordinancy and no direct fault in it; the minor practice of this religion (young) also protects from greatness.
"2.41 Here, O joy of the Kurus, there is but a single one-pointed determination; many-branched and endless are the thoughts of the irresolute.","O Qur’an, in this (subject) there is the same determining wisdom; the wisdom of the ignorant men is greatly distinctive and eternal."
"2.42 Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, taking pleasure in the eulogising words of the Vedas, O Arjuna, saying, ""There is nothing else.""",2.42 O Parth Aviveki men who are rammed in the weddism who speak this word of the Father (Dekavti Shawa)? there is nothing greater than that (from heaven).
"2.43 Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, (they utter speech which is directed to ends) leading to new births as the result of their works, and prescribe various methods abounding in specific actions, for the attainment of pleasure and power.",2.43 Those who believe the heavens best tell the many acts to obtain devotion and devotion which (in fact) are to give birth-like karmafruits.
"2.44 For those who are attached to pleasure and power, whose minds are drawn away by such teaching, ï1thatï1 determinate reason is not formed which is steadily bent on meditation and Samadhi (superconscious state).","2.44 Those whose mind has been taken all of them, in the discretion of men who have such devotion and asphericity, there is no certainty, i.e. they are not worthy to practice the attention."
"2.45 The Vedas deal with the three attributes (of Nature); be thou above these three attributes. O Arjuna, free yourself from the pairs of opposites, and ever remain in the ality of Sattva (goodness), freed from (the thought of) acisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.","2.45 O Arjuna, the subject of the wedds is related to three qualities (from the world), you are triangulated, unparalleled, located in the purity (cleanity), and be free of yoga and self-righteous."
"2.46 To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.",2.46 As much purpose remains in the small reservoir of man when there is a perfect reservoir from all sides? as much purpose remains in all veids of self-knowledge brahman.
"2.47 Thy right is to work only, but never with its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction.",2.47 Do you have the right to do the work? never in the fruit. do you not have the work of the work and do you not have the right to do the work of the work.
"2.48 Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.","2.48 O righteous people, give up the person and do the work in the yoga while you are situated in the proof and in the ignorance; this practice is called yoga."
"2.49 Far lower than the Yoga of wisdon is action, O Arjuna. Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are they whose motive is the fruit.","2.49 Are the works of this wisdom more unhealthy than the works of this wisdom? therefore, o righteous men, take refuge to the wisdom, and those who desire fruit are grace."
"2.50 Endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action.",2.50 Is there a man with understanding here (in this life) that honour and sin give up these two works?
"2.51 The wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil.","2.51 Manish people with intelligence, by giving up the fruit of work, get an innocent, i.e. an innocent position, free from birth-like bonds."
"2.52 When thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard.","2:52.When your wisdom will go to the mourap, then will you get unwilling from all the things which are heard and heard."
"2.53 When thy intellect, which is perplexed by the Veda text, which thou hast read, shall stand immovable and steady in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-realisation.","2.53 When your intelligence, disturbed from listening to many kinds of subjects, will become unmoving and stable in its form, then you will obtain (permार्थ) yoga."
"2.54 Arjuna said  What, O Krishna, is the description of him who has steady wisdom, and is merged in the superconscious state? How does one of steady wisdom speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?","2.54 Arjuna said -- What is the characteristic of a man with a stable intelligence located in the Keshov period, stable intelligence how man speaks how he sits how he moves?"
"2.55 The Blessed Lord said  When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom.","The Lord God said, “Partus, when a man gives up all the desires in his mind and is satisfied with the Spirit?"
"2.56 He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures, and is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.",2.56 In suffering whose mind was not opened in pleasure whose sphera has been reversed; from whose mind is anger; fear and anger have been destroyed.
"2.57 He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, who neither rejoices not hastes, his wisdom is fixed.","2:57. and whoever has not received the good and the unpleasant things, and is not pleased, nor is he pleased; his prayer is righteous."
"2.58 When, like the tortoise which withdraws on all sides its limbs, he withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, then his wisdom becomes steady.","2.58 The sheep takes his organs as well as this man, when he overwhelms his senses from all sides with the subjects of the senses, then his intelligence is stable."
2.59 The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man leaving the longing (behind); but his longing also turns away on seeing the Supreme.,"2.59 And the disappointing bodies are distant from men, but the disappointment of this (man) is also distant when he sees the ultimate element."
"2.60 The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise man though he be striving (to control them).",2.60 Those who are trying (to accomplish) even the mind of the wise man (of the wise man) are strongly taken by these men.
"2.61 Having restrained them all he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control.",2.61 All those men shall be limited and compassionate; whose men's men's men's men are in possession?
"2.62 When a man thinks of the objects, attachment for them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises.",2.2.62. the man who thinks of subjects becomes insight in it; insight generates anger from desire and desire.
2.63 From anger comes delusion; from delusion loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; from the destruction of discrimination he perishes.,"2.63. from anger arises moh and moh from memory distortion. when memory is confused, intelligence is destroyed and when intelligence is destroyed, man is destroyed."
"2.64 But the self-controlled man, moving among the objects with the senses under restraint and free from attraction and repulsion, attains to peace.",2.4.4 The self-conciliation (the self-conciliation) of the man without the righteousness (the self-conciliation) obtains the pleasure (the pleasure) of the subjects by the self-conciliation (the self-conciliation) made in his possession.
2.65 In that peace all pains are destroyed; for the intellect of the tranil-minded soon becomes steady.,"2.65 When there is offer, all suffering ends, and the wisdom of the pleased man soon stabilizes."
"2.66 There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady and to the unsteady no meditation is possible, and to the unmeditative there can be no peace, and to the man who has no peace, how can there be happiness?",2.66 The united man would not have knowledge (self) and the united man would not have the ability of sense and attention; the united man would not have peace; the united man would not have pleasure.
"2.67 For the mind, which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters.","2.67 Every one takes the boat like the air in the water, just as the imitation of the intellect which he thinks is among the enthusiasts in the subjects; the same intellect takes every prophesy of it."
"2.68 Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from sense-objects.","2.68 Therefore, o great man whose minds are all kinds made in the possession of human matters? his wisdom is stable."
"2.69 That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man is awake; when all beings are awake, that is night for the Muni (sage) who sees.","2.69 For all beings which is night, in which the humble man wakes up, and where all beings wakes up, it is night for the humble who sees."
"2.70 He attains peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean which, filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the man who is full of desires.","2.70 As from all sides the waters (not distorted by it) flow in the sea of perfect unrighteous reputation (of many rivers), so shall the man whom the desires go into him (not generating wickedness) the man gain peace, not the man whom the desires are."
"2.71 That man attains peace who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without the sense of mine and without egoism.","The man who gives up all his desires, and does not give up his desires, and does not give up his desires, and does not give up his desires, and does not give up his desires?"
"2.72 This is the Brahmic seat (eternal state), O son of Pritha. Attaining to this, none is deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life, one attains to oneness with Brahman.","2.72 This is a brahmi state; to obtain it the man would not be engaged; even in the end of the time, by being placed in this faith, he obtained the brahmi (unity with brahmi)."
"3.1 Arjuna said  If Thou thinkest that knowledge is superior to action, O Krishna, why then, O Kesava, dost Thou ask me to engage in this terrible action?","If you believe that knowledge is better than karma, then why do you tend me to this terrible karma?"
"3.2 With this apparently perplexing speech, Thou confusest, as it were, my understanding; therefore tell me that one way for certain by which I may attain bliss.",2.3.2 With this mixed phrase you mouths my wisdom so you say the one (the way) by which I can obtain the ultimate trust.
"3.3 The Blessed Lord said  In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one; the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogins.","3 And the Lord said, O unpunishment, Arjuna, two kinds of faith in this shlook have been said before me, by the knowledge of the wise and by the work of the youths."
3.4 Not by non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection.,"3.4 The man does not obtain naturalness by not doing the works, nor by the sanctuation of the works he obtains proof (fullness)."
3.5 Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for everyone is made to act helplessly indeed by the alities born of Nature.,"3.5. no man can ever be without a temporary work, because it is carried out from all (male) who are deceived by the qualities arising from nature."
"3.6 He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he of deluded understanding is called a hypocrite.","3.6 Whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, whoever is wise."
"3.7 But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels.","7 But, O Arjuna, whoever works with man’s minds in possession of men, is the best."
"3.8 Do thou perform (thy) bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction and even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for thee by inaction.","3:8 And do the work of your destiny, for the work is better than the work of the wrongdoing, and your body will not be proven from the work of the wrongdoing."
"3.9 The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment.","3.9 In addition to the work done for the knowledge, it is linked by the work of men, so give up the person and act the work for the purpose of the knowledge."
"3.10 The Creator, having in the beginning (of creation) created mankind together with sacrifice, said, ""By this shall ye propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires (the cow which yields all the desired objects).""","3:10 And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) created a people, including the knowledge, and said: Through this knowledge you will gain growth, and this knowledge will be fulfilling the desires you want."
"3.11 With this do ye nourish the gods and may those gods nourish you; thus nourishing one another, ye shall attain to the highest good.","3:11 Through this knowledge advance the gods, and they will advance you as the gods; thus you will receive the ultimate righteousness by advancing each other."
"3.12 The gods, nourished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. So, he who enjoys the objects given by the gods without offering (in return) to them, is verily a thief.","3:12 The gods that are fed by the knowledge will provide you with food; the foods that they give, which men eat without giving them, is indeed a thief."
3.13 The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are freed from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food (only) for their own sake verily eat sin.,"13 The best men who eat the remaining food of the knowledge are free from all sins, but those who cook only for themselves, they eat only sins."
3.14 From food come forth beings; from rain food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain and sacrifice is born of action.,3.14 All creatures are born from food from the origin of food; the origin of food is born from knowledge and from the works of knowledge.
"3.15 Know thou that action comes from Brahma and Brahma comes from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervading (Brahma) ever rests in sacrifice.",3.15 The origin of karma comes from the brahmaji and the brahmaji letters are expressed by the intelligence. therefore all the broad brahma is always distinguished in the knowledge.
"3.16 He who does not follow here the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Arjuna.","3.16 The man who does not follow the cycle that has been trained in this way here, the man of sin age who runs in the parths, wins vainly."
"3.17 But for that man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self and who is content in the Self alone, verily there is nothing to do.","3:17 But whoever is satisfied in the Spirit that is in the Spirit, and satisfied in the Spirit, there is no duty for him."
3.18 For him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object.,"3.18 In this world, that man has no intention from acts and uncleanity, and neither is he dependent on the spirit for any object."
"3.19 Therefore without attachment, do thou always perform action which should be done; for by performing action without attachment man reaches the Supreme.","3:19 Therefore, you shall be unreliable and always act in accordance with the work of duty; for the unreliable man receives the Spirit by doing the work."
3.20 Janaka and others attained perfection verily by action only; even with a view to the protection of the masses thou shouldst perform action.,3:20 And the people (the knowledge of the people) also see the people (the people) who have gained awareness through the work; and you are worthy of doing.
"3.21 Whatsoever a great man does, that the other men also do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world (mankind) follows.","As the best man behaves, the other people also simulate the same; the man who proves something, the people also follow it."
"3.22 There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that should be done by Me, nor is there anything unattained that should be attained; yet I engage Myself in action.","3:22 Though I have no duty in the trial, and even the little thing which is to be obtained is not sufficient, I am still in the work."
"3.23 For, should I not ever engage Myself in action, unwearied, men would in every way follow My path, O Arjuna.","3:23 And if I was wary, I would not keep in the work, O Parath, in every way man will follow My path."
3.24 These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; I should be the author of confusion of castes and destruction of these beings.,"24 If I do not act, all these peoples will be destroyed; and I will be the servant of the righteous, and the destroyer of this people."
"3.25 As the ignorant men act from attachment to action, O Bharata (Arjuna), so should the wise act without attachment, wishing the welfare of the world.",3.25 O India! the ignorants who are in the karma do the same work as the scientists do the same work by the desire of the people’s collection (people’s well-being).
"3.26 Let no wise man unsettle the mind of ignorant people who are attached to action; he should engage them in all actions, himself fulfilling them with devotion.","3:26 The wise man shall not cause confusion in the wisdom of the ignorants who are in the works, and shall be self-contained and act as well as the works, and shall do the same with them."
"3.27 All actions are wrought in all cases by the alities of Nature only. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks, ""I am the doer.""","3.27 The whole work is done by the qualities of nature, the man enthusiastic of ego, “I am the worker” thus considers."
"3.28 But he who knows the Truth, O mighty-armed (Arjuna), about the divisions of the alities and (their) functions, knowing that the Gunas as senses move amidst the Gunas as the sense-objects, is not attached.","3:28 But O great, the wise man who knows the truth of the department of qualities and charity, knowing that “the qualities are in qualities” (in charity) would not be astonished."
3.29 Those deluded by the alities of Nature are attached to the functions of the alities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one who is of imperfect knowledge.,"3:29 And the men who are worshipped by the qualities of nature are inherent in the qualities and in the karma, and the men who have incomplete knowledge shall not be distracted by the men who have full knowledge."
"3.30 Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred in the Self, free from hope and egoism, and from (mental) fever, do thou fight.","3:30 Through all the works in me, without hope and desire, you fight without compassion."
"3.31 Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine with faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from actions.","3:31 Those who follow this My commandment in a righteous manner, unconscious and honoured, will be free from the works."
"3.32 But those who carp at My teaching and do not practise it, deluded of all knowledge, and devoid of discrimination, know them to be doomed to destruction.","3:32. but those who do not follow this my law, you shall understand that all those who are wise in knowledge have been destroyed."
"3.33 Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature; beings will follow Nature; what can 
restraint do?","33 And the wise man also tries according to his nature; all creatures go on their nature, then what will the grace in them do."
"3.34 Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses; let none come under their sway; for, they are his foes.","3:34 Those who are wrathful to the matter of the Indigenous (i.e. every Indigenous) (in the minds) do not want man to be in their hands, for they are its enemies."
"3.35 Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear (is productive of danger).","3:35 And the righteous is the righteous, and the righteous is the righteous, and the righteous is the righteous, and the righteous is the righteous, and the righteous is the righteous."
"3.36 Arjuna said  But impelled by what does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O Varshneya (Krishna), constrained as it were, by force?","3:36 And Arjuna said, O worshippers! then this man, even though he was as unwanted as he was strongly bound, by whom is inspired and commits sin?"
"3.37 The Blessed Lord said  It is desire, it is anger both of the ality of Rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as the foe here (in this world).","37 And the Lord said, This is the work that was born in Rajogun, this is anger; this is the greatness (which is great) and the greatness, this is what you know here (in this world) the enemy."
"3.38 As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by the amnion, so is this enveloped by that.","3:38. as the smoke covers the mirror with fire and the dust, and as the fetus covers the uterus, so it (knowledge) is driven by it."
"3.39 O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire.","3:39. like the fire which is difficult to satisfy, such a way, this point of wisdom is worn by the enemy."
"3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom.","3.40 The intelligences, the mind and the intelligence are called its place of residence; this work by them alone, by accumulating knowledge, attracts the body man."
"3.41 Therefore, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation.","Thus, o Arjuna, you first take the men in possession, and destroy this kind of sin, the destroyer of wisdom and science."
3.42 They say that the senses are superior (to the body); superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; one who is superior even to the intellect is He (the Self).,"3:42. (from the body) the best men are said; the mind is beyond the men and the wisdom is beyond the mind, and the one who is beyond the wisdom is the Spirit."
"3.43 Thus knowing Him Who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to coner.","Thus, knowing the Spirit beyond wisdom and possessing the Spirit through wisdom, O great, kill this wicked enemy."
4.1 The Blessed Lord said  I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku.,"4:1 And the Lord said, I said this undestructive yoga to Visswan (the god of the sun), and Visswan said to Manu, and Manu said to Isswan."
"4.2 This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by long lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa (burner of the foes).","4:2 Thus did the righteous know that this yoga was obtained from the tradition, (but) the yoga was destroyed here (in this people) from a long time."
"4.3 That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for thou art My devotee and My friend; it is the supreme secret.","This is this ancient yoga that I have told you today, for you are my servants and friends; this is the best secret."
"4.4 Arjuna said  Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to understand that Thou taughtest this Yoga in the beginning?","4 And Arjuna said, Your birth is up, that is, of the aftermath, and your birth is of the east, so how can I know that you have said before?"
"4.5 The Blessed Lord said  Many births of Mine have passed as well as of thine, O Arjuna; I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa (scorcher of foes).","4:5 And the Lord said, ""O Arjuna, many of you and me have been born, but I know them all, and you do not know."""
"4.6 Though I am unborn, of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing My own Nature, I am born by My own Maya.","4.6 Although I am an unthinkable and unthinkable shape, and I am the God of the wicked, I am born from my Maya by holding my nature under my possession."
"4.7 Whenever there is decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then I manifest Myself.","4.7 O India, when the loss of religion and injustice are increasing, then I reveal myself."
"4.8 For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked and for the establishment of righteousness, I am born in every age.","4.8 For the protection of the sad men, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of religion, I am revealed in every age."
"4.9 He who thus know, in their true light, My divine birth and action, having abandoned the body, is not born again, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.","“O Arjuna, my birth and karma is divine, so the man who knows, he shouldn’t give up the body and receive birth again; he only receives me."
"4.10 Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being.","4.10.Rag fearless and angerless, many men who have been my shelter have received my swarup, sanctified by wisdom."
"4.11 In whatever way men approach Me even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna.","4:11 Those who eat me as they eat me, I also give grace to them; O Lord, all men, in all ways, follow my own path."
4.12 Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods; because success is ickly attained by men through action.,[4:12] Here (in this people) they worship the gods who desire the fruit of the works; for in the people the fruit of the works is soon obtained.
4.13 The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma; though I am the author thereof know Me as non-doer and immutable.,"4:13 Though I am the servant of it, you know me unto the wicked and unthinable."
"4.14 Actions do not taint Me, nor have I a desire for the fruit of actions. He who knows Me thus is not bound by actions.",4:14 Karma does not lie me; I do not have spheres in karma; thus the one who knows me does not bind me by the works.
"4.15 Having known this, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action; therefore do thou also perform action, as did the ancients in days of yore.",4:15 Thus was also done by the men of the east with knowledge; so do also the works that the ancestors have done forever.
"4.16 What is action? What is inaction? As to this even the wise are confused. Therefore I shall teach thee such action (the nature of action and inaction) by knowing which thou shalt be liberated from the evil (of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death).","4:16 What is karma, and what is unacrime, and the wise men are confused in this; so I will call you karma, whom you will be free from the unhappy, knowing."
"4.17 For verily (the true nature) of action (enjoined by the scriptures) should be known, also (that) 
of forbidden (or unlawful) action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature (path) of action.","4:17 He must know the form of the work, and he must know the form of the wicked; he must know the form of the wicked, and he must know the form of the wicked, for the speed of the work is intense."
"4.18 He who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a Yogi and performer of all actions.","4:18 Whoever sees the man in the work and the work in the work, he is wise among men, he will do all the works."
"4.19 He whose undertakings are all devoid of desires and (selfish) purposes and whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge,  him the wise call a sage.","4.19. whose all works are free of desire and determination, such the man with the works filled with fire in the form of knowledge is called the wise man."
"4.20 Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of the action, ever content, depending on nothing, he does not do anything though engaged in activity.","4:20 Whoever gives up the workforce, is satisfied and free of all shelters, he does nothing, even though he tends to work."
"4.21 Without hope and with the mind and the self controlled, having abandoned all covetousness, doing mere bodily action, he incurs no sin.","4.21 Whoever is hopeless and whoever has reduced the mind and the soul (the body), whoever has abandoned all things, such man does not receive sin even when he does physical works."
"4.22 Content with what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposites and envy, even-minded in success and failure, though acting, he is not bound.",4:22 And the man who is satisfied with what he has achieved shall not be bound by the work of the man who is satisfied with what he has achieved; and the man who is not satisfied with what he has achieved shall not be bound by the work of the man who is not satisfied with what he has achieved; and the man who is not satisfied with what he has achieved shall not be bound by the work of the man who is not satisfied with what he has achieved.
"4.23 To one who is devoid of attchment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, who works for the sake of sacrifice (for the sake of God), the whole action is dissolved.","4.23 Whoever is powerless and free, whose mind is in knowledge, all the works of such man who acts for knowledge become linen."
4.24 Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in action.,4.24 The worship (i.e. the means of worship) is brahm and the worship is brahm; the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship of the worship.
4.25 Some Yogies perform sacrifice to the gods alone; while others (who have realised the Self) offer the self as sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman alone.,4.25 Some of the Yogians only do the prayer of the gods; and others (the knowledgeers) need the prayer by the prayer in the world.
4.26 Some again offer the organ of hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses.,"4.26 Other (yogians) shrothradic all men need in the fire, and other (men) word subjects need in the fire."
4.27 Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath (vital energy or Prana) in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint kindled by knowledge.,4.27 The other (yogians) need the works of all men and souls in the self-conciliation fire which is revealed by knowledge.
"4.28 Others again offer wealth, austerity and Yoga as sacrifice, while the ascetics of self-restraint and rigid vows offer study of scriptures and knowledge as sacrifice.","4:28 And some (the righteous) are the wise, the righteous, and the righteous; and others are the wise, and the righteous, the righteous."
"4.29 Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the outgoing, restraining the course of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the restraint of the breath.","4.29 Others (yogians) need the atmosphere in the atmosphere, and give the atmosphere of the atmosphere in the soul, by stopping the speed of the atmosphere and of the atmosphere, they are the equivalent of the atmosphere."
"4.30 Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in life-breaths. All these are knowers of sacrifice, whose sins are destroyed by sacrifice.","4:30 Those who eat regularly (the righteous genes) need souls in souls; they are all the knowledgeers, whose sins have been destroyed by knowledge."
"4.31 Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for the man who does not perform sacrifice; how then can he have the other, O Arjuna?","4.31 O greatest! the men who eat the remaining immortal of the knowledge receive the sanathan brahma. the man without the knowledge does not even get this people, then how will the perlak get?"
"4.32 Thus, manifold sacrifices are spread out before Brahman (literally) at the mouth or face of Brahman). Know them all as born of action and thus knowing, thou shalt be liberated.","4.32 Such many kinds of knowledge are spread in the face of the universe, i.e. they are described; know them all from the works; thus knowing you will be free."
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,4:33 But the wise man is better than the wise man who is fulfilled by the fluids; the wise man is better than the wise man; the wise man is better than the wise man; the wise man is better than the wise man.
"4.34 Know That by long prostration, by estion and by service; the wise who have realised the Truth will instruct thee in (that) knowledge.","4:34 Know that (knowledge) by asking, asking, and serving; these wise and wise men will preach you the knowledge."
"4.35 Knowing ï1thatï1 thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again get deluded like this; and by that thou shalt see all beings in thy Self and also in Me.","4:35 Those whom you know will not regain the temptation, and Those whom you will see the temptation in your shape and in me."
"4.36 Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt verily cross all sins by the raft of knowledge.","If you are more sinners than all the sinners, then by the boat of wisdom, you will surely be deceived of all the sins."
"4.37 As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.","4:37 Just as the bright fire disappears, so, Arjuna, the wise fire disappears all the works."
"4.38 Verily, there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga finds it in the Self in time.",4.38 There is in this people nothing that sanctifies as knowledge; the man who is famous in yoga himself receives him in the spirit in the (righteous) time.
"4.39 The man who is full of faith, who is devoted to it, and who has subdued the senses obtains (this) knowledge; and having obtained the knowledge he attains at once to the supreme peace.","4.39 A respectful, hopeful and wise man acquires knowledge; by acquiring knowledge he soon acquires ultimate peace."
"4.40 The ignorant the faithless, the doubting self goes to destruction; there is neither this world nor the other, nor happiness for the doubting.","4:40 Unknown and unhappy and suspicious men are destroyed, for the suspicious man there is no people, nor pleasure, nor pleasure."
"4.41 He who has renounced actions by Yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, and who is self-possessed  actions do not bind him, O Arjuna.","4.41 Whoever has sanctified the works by yoga, by wisdom whose assumptions have been destroyed, such self-winning man, o righteous man, does not binding the works."
"4.42 Therefore with the sword of the knowledge (of the Self) cut asunder the doubt of the self born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, and take refuge in Yoga. Arise, O Arjuna.","4.42. therefore, by cutting the self-subjective suspicion arising from ignorance in your heart from the crossing of knowledge, O India! stand up with the shelter of yoga."
"5.1 Arjuna said  Renunciation of actions, O Krishna, Thou praisest, and again Yoga. Tell me conclusively that which is the better of the two.","5:1 And Arjuna said, ""Khrish! you praise the sanctuations of the works, and then praise the yoga (the behavior of the work)."
"5.2 The Blessed Lord said  Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.","5:2 And the Lord said, The work and the work are both the greatest, but the work is best among them than the work."
"5.3 He should be known as a perpertual Sannyasi who neither hates nor desires; for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily set free from bondage.","5.3 Whoever man does not desire to anyone, nor desire to anyone, he is always sanny; for, oh great, man without the duties becomes freed by bonds."
"5.4 Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action or the performance of action as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one obtains the fruits of both.","5.4 Children, i.e. children of childhood, understand statistics (sanyas) and yoga differently; even in one man who is situated in the same kind receives the fruit of both."

13.22 The soul seated in Nature experiences the alities born of Nature; attachment to the alities is the cause of its birth in good and evil wombs.,13.22 The man in nature enjoys the qualities arising from nature; the same of these qualities is the reason for the birth in the happy and unhappy vagina of this man (life).
"13.23 The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord and the Supreme Self.","13:23 The ultimate man in this body is called subtrahts, permits, worshippers, worshippers, gods and gods."

"13.32 Being without beginning and being devoid of (any) alities, the Supreme Self, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted.","13:32 This God is unfair from being unclean and unclean; even if it is in the body, it does not (work) nor (from the fruits) it is unclean."
"13.33 As the all-pervading ether is not tainted, because of its subtlety, so the Self seated everywhere in the body is not tainted.","13:33 As the whole heavens were not filled because of their subtility, so the whole body was not filled by the spirit."
"13.34 Just as the one sun illumines the whole world, so also the Lord of the field (Supreme Self) 
illumines the whole field, O Arjuna.","Oh India! as the same sun reveals this whole people, the same region (regional) reveals the whole area."
"13.35 They who, by the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the field and its knower and also the liberation from the Nature of being, go to the Supreme.","13.35 Thus, those who know the difference between the region and the region by the knowledge, and the salvation by the disorders of nature, they obtain the ultimate universe."
