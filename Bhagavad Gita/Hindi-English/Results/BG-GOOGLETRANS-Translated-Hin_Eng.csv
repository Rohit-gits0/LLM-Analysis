whereas that army of theirs marshelled by Bhima is sufficient.",".1.10..Our army protected by Bhishma is inadequate; But their army protected by Bheema is sufficient or, our army protected by Bheema is unlimited but their army protected by Bheema is limited."

conches.","..1.14..After this, Madhav (Shri Krishna) and Pandu's son Arjun, sitting in a grand chariot with white horses, also blew their divine conch shells."

conch Paundra.","1.15 Lord Hrishikesh blew Panchjanya, Dhananjay (Arjun) blew Devdutt and Bhima, who did terrible deeds, blew the great conch called Paundu."

Dhritarashtra's party, making both the heaven and the earth resound.",..1.19..That terrible roar started echoing in the sky and the earth and it tore the hearts of Dhritarashtra's sons.
"1.20. Then, seeing the people of Dhritarashtra’s party standing
arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of
Pandu, whose ensign was a monkey, took up his bow and said the following
to Krishna, O Lord of the earth.","..1.20..O Mahipate! Thus, when the war was about to begin, Kapidhwaja Arjuna, seeing Dhritarashtra's sons positioned, raised his bow and said these words to Lord Hrishikesh."

O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.","..1.21..Arjun said - Hey! Achyut, make my chariot stand between the two armies."

O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.","..1.22..So that I can observe these people standing with the desire for war, with whom I have to fight in this war."
"1.23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight,
wishing to please in battle the evil-minded Duryodhana (the son of Dhritarashtra).","..1.23..These kings and the lovers of foolish Dhartarashtra (Duryodhana) who have gathered here in the war, I will see those warriors."
"1.24. Sanjaya said  Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna, having stationed that
best of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies.","..1.24..Sanjay said – O Bharat (Dhritarashtra)! On Arjuna saying this, Lord Hrishikesh placed the best chariot between the two armies."
"1.25. In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the
earth, said: ""O Arjuna (son of Pritha), behold these Kurus gathered together.""","..1.25.. In front of Bhishma, Drona and all the rulers of the earth, he said, “O Partha, look at the Kauravas gathered here”."

fathers and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons
and friends too.","..1.26..There Arjun saw his father's brothers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, father-in-laws and brother-in-laws standing in those two armies."
"1.27. (He saw) fathers-in-law and friends also in both the armies.
The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those kinsmen thus standing arrayed,
spoke this, sorrowfully filled with deep pity.","1.27. Seeing all those relatives standing like this, Kunti's son Arjun's heart was filled with compassion and he said this in sadness."
"1.28. Arjuna said  Seeing these, my kinsmen, O krishna, arrayed, eager to fight.","1.28 1.29 Arjun said - O Krishna! Seeing these relatives present with the desire to fight, my limbs become weak, my mouth is also dry and my body is trembling and thrilled."
"1.29. My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body ivers and
my hair stands on end.","1.28 1.29 Arjun said - O Krishna!  Seeing these relatives present with the desire to fight, my limbs become weak, my mouth is also dry and my body is trembling and thrilled."
"1.30. The (bow) Gandiva slips from my hand, and also my skins burns
all over; I am unable even to stand and my mind is reeling, as it were.","..1.30..Gandiva (bow) is falling from my hand and the skin is burning. My mind is becoming confused, and I am unable to stand."
"1.31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava. I do not see any good
in killing my kinsmen in battle.",..1.31..O Keshav! I am seeing the opposite in the omens and I do not see any benefit in killing my relatives in the war.
"1.32. I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.
Of what avail is dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?","..1.32..O Krishna! I neither want victory, nor kingdom, nor happiness. Hey Govind! What use do we have from the state or from pleasures or even from living?"
"1.33. Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,
stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.","..1.33..Those for whom we desire kingdom, enjoyment and happiness, they are the ones who have given up the hope of wealth and life and are standing in the war."
"1.34. Teachers, fathers, sons and also grandfathers, maternal uncles,
fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives,-","..1.34..Those people are Gurujan, paternal uncle, uncle, son, paternal grandfather, father-in-law, grandson, shyalak and other relatives."
"1.35. These I do not wish to kill, though they kill me, O Krishna,
even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds; leave alone killing
them for the sake of the earth.","..1.35..O Madhusudan!  I don't want to kill them even if they kill me or for the kingdom of Trilokya, to say nothing of the earth."
"1.36. By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can
be ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue to us from killing these felons.",..1.36..O Janardan! What pleasure will we get by killing the sons of Dhritarashtra?  By killing these terrorists we will only feel guilty.
"1.37. Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra,
our relatives; for how can we be happy by killing our own people, O Madhava
(Krishna)?","..1.37..O Madhava!  Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of our kinsman Dhritarashtra, because how can we be happy by killing our own relatives."
"1.38. Though they, with intelligence overpowered by greed, see
no evil in the destruction of families, and no sin in hostility to friends,","..1.38..Although these people, corrupted by greed, do not see sin in the evil committed by them and in betrayal of friends."
"1.39. Why should not we who clearly see evil in the destruction
of families, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana (Krishna)?","..1.39..But, O Janardan!  Why should we, who know the harm caused by Kulakshaya, not think of abstaining from this sin?"
"1.40. In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious
rites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety,
indeed, overcomes the whole family.","1.40 Sanatan Dharma gets destroyed due to the destruction of the clan. When Dharma is destroyed, Adharma (sin) suppresses the entire family."
"1.41. By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of
the family become corrupt; and , women being corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant
of Vrishni), there arises intermingling of castes.","..1.41..O Krishna! Due to increase in sin the women of the family become polluted, and O Varshneya! When women become infected, hybrids arise."
"1.42. Confusion of castes leads to hell the slayers of the family,
for their forefathers fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-ball and
water (libations).","..1.42..That caste hybrid causes the murderers and the clan to go to hell. Deprived of the rituals of Pinda and Jaldaan, their ancestors also fall into hell."
"1.43. By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which
cause confusion of castes, the eternal religious rites of the caste and
the family are destroyed.","..1.43.. Due to these varnasankar causative defects, the eternal family religion and caste religion are destroyed due to family-killing defects."
"1.44. We have heard, O Janardana, that inevitable is the dwelling
for an unknown period in hell for those men in whose families the religious
practices have been destroyed.","..1.44..O Janardan!  We have heard that those people whose family religion is destroyed, reside in hell indefinitely."
"1.45. Alas! We are involved in a great sin, in that we are
prepared to kill our kinsmen, through greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.","..1.45..Oh!  It is sad that we have decided to commit a huge sin, and are ready to destroy our family due to the greed of this kingdom."
"1.46. If the sons of Dhritarashtra with weapons in hand should
slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.","..1.46..If these armed Kauravas kill me in battle, who is unarmed and does not fight back, it will still be beneficial for me."
"1.47. Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna,
casting away his bow and arrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot with
his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.","..1.47..Sanjay said – Arjuna, distraught with grief in the battlefield (Sankhye), saying thus, left the bow with the arrows and sat in the rear part of the chariot."
"2.1 Sanjaya said  To him who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, Madhusudana (the destroyer of Madhu) or Krishna spoke these words.",".2.1. Sanjaya said - Thus, overwhelmed with compassion and sadness, Madhusudan said this sentence to the tearful-eyed Arjuna."
"2.2 The Blessed Lord said  Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of you, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon you, O Arjuna?",".2.2. Shri Bhagwan said – O Arjun! Where did you get this fascination for this strange place?  Contrary to Arya conduct, it is neither a means of attaining heaven nor is it a source of fame."
"2.3 Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha. It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean weakness of the heart! Stand up, O scorcher of the foes!","..2.3.. O Partha, don't be a coward. This is unbecoming of you, hey! Leave aside the petty weakness of the heart and stand up."
"2.4 Arjuna said  How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?","2.4. Arjun said--O Madhusudan! How will I fight with arrows in the battlefield with Bhishma and Drona. O Arisudan, both of them are worthy of worship."
"2.5 Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires will be stained with (their) blood.","..2.5.. Taking alms in this world is more beneficial than killing these great teachers, because by killing the teachers, I will enjoy only the blood-stained pleasures of wealth and lust in this world."
"2.6 I can hardly tell which will be better, that we should  coner them or that they should coner us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us.","..2.6.. We don't know what we should do. We don't even know whether we will win, or whether they will win over us, those whom we do not want to kill and live, those sons of Dhritarashtra are standing in front of us for the war."
2.7 My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity; my mind is confused as to duty. I ask Thee: Tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who has taken refuge in Thee.,"..2.7.. Overwhelmed by the taint of compassion and confused on the path of duty, I ask you to say with certainty whatever is best for me, because I am your disciple; Please give me advice when I take refuge in you."
"2.8 I do not see that it would remove this sorrow that burns up my senses, even if I should attain prosperous and unrivalled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods.","..2.8.. Despite having an uninterruptedly prosperous kingdom on earth and the ownership of the gods, I do not see a solution that can remove this grief that is drying up my senses."
"2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the coneror of sleep), the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna, ""I will not fight"" and became silent.","..2.9.. Sanjay said - Thus, Gudakesh Parantap Arjun became silent after saying to Lord Hrishikesh, O Govind, ""I will not fight."""
"2.10 To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Krishna, as if smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words.",..2.10.. O India (Dhritarashtra)! Lord Hrishikesh laughingly said these words to the grieving Arjun in between the two armies.
"2.11 The Blessed Lord said  Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.","2.11. Sri Bhagavan said - (Ashochyan) For those for whom it is not appropriate to mourn, you mourn and speak words to the wise, but wise men do not mourn for both the dead (gatasuna) and the living (agatasuna). Are.."
"2.12 Nor at any time indeed was I not, nor thou, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease to be hereafter.","2.12. In reality, it is neither the case that I did not exist at any time or you were not there or these kings were not there nor is it the case that we all will not exist from this onwards."
"2.13 Just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does it pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat.","2.13. Just as the physical soul in this body undergoes puberty, youth and old age, similarly it attains another body;  A patient person is not attracted by this."
"2.14 The contacts of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold, pleasure and pain, have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna.","..2.14.. O son of Kunti! There is a beginning and end to the combination of cold and heat and the senses and objects that give happiness and sorrow;  They are impermanent, therefore, O Bharat! You tolerate them."
"2.15 That firm man whom, surely, these afflict not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality.","2.15. Oh best man! The patient person who remains equanimous in pain and pleasure and cannot be troubled by these, is entitled to immortality (salvation)."
2.16 The unreal hath no being; there is non-being of the real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the Truth (or the seers of the Essence).,"..2.16.. The unreal does not exist and the real never exists. In this way, the essence of both of these has been seen by wise men."
"2.17 Know that to be indestructible, by Which all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable.","..2.17.. You should know that thing as imperishable, which pervades this entire universe. No one is capable of destroying this element."
"2.18 These bodies of the embodied Self, Which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore fight, O Arjuna.",..2.18.. All these bodies of this imperishable immeasurable eternal bodily soul are said to be perishable. That's why India! You fight.
"2.19 He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks It is slain, neither of them ï1knowsï1. It slays not, nor is It slain.","..2.19.. The one who considers this soul to be a killer and the one who considers it dead, both do not know, because this soul neither dies nor is killed."
"2.20 It is not born, nor does It ever die; after having been, It again ceases not to be; unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed.",".2.20. This soul is neither born nor dies in any time nor is it going to exist once and then disappear again. This soul is unborn, eternal, eternal and ancient, it does not get destroyed even after the destruction of the body."
"2.21 Whosoever knows It to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and inexhaustible, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain?","2.21. Hey Parth! The man who knows this soul to be indestructible, eternal and eternal, how will he cause whom to die and how will he kill whom?"
"2.22 Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new.",".2.22. Just as a human being gives up old clothes and puts on new clothes, similarly the soul gives up old bodies and acquires new bodies."
"2.23 Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not.",..2.23.. Weapons cannot cut this soul nor can fire burn it; Water cannot wet it and air cannot dry it.
"2.24 This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted, nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and ancient.","..2.24.. Because this soul is achhedya (cannot be cut), adhaya (cannot be burnt), akledya (cannot get wet) and ashoshya (cannot be dried);  It is eternal, omnipresent, stable, immovable and eternal."
"2.25 This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve.","..2.25.. This soul is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable;  Therefore, it is not right for you to feel sad after knowing it like this."
"2.26 But even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve.","..2.26.. And even if you consider the soul to be born daily and die daily, O mighty-armed one!  It is not appropriate for you to mourn like this."
"2.27 For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve.","..2.27.. Death of one who is born is certain and birth of one who dies is certain;  Therefore, you should not mourn over what is permanent and inevitable."
"2.28 Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifested again in their end. What is there to grieve about?",..2.28.. Hey India! All living beings remain in latent state before birth and after death and become manifest in between. Then what is there to worry or mourn about?
"2.29 One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet having heard, none understands It at all.",..2.29.. Some look upon it as a matter of surprise;  Someone speaks of it as a matter of surprise;  And any other man hears it with surprise;  And then no one knows even after listening.
"2.30 This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is ever indestructible, O Arjuna; therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.","..2.30.. Hey India! This physical soul is always present in everyone's body, hence it is not appropriate for you to mourn for all living beings."
"2.31 Further, having regard to thy duty, shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.","..2.31.. And it is not right for you to get disturbed even after seeing your own religion, because there is no other more beneficial duty for a Kshatriya than righteous war."
"2.32 Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna! who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself as an open door to heaven.",..2.32.. And O Parth! Only the fortunate Kshatriya people get to have this kind of war which is achieved automatically and which opens the door to heaven.
"2.33 But if thou wilt not fight this righteous war, then having abandoned thine own duty and fame, thou shalt incur sin.",".2.33. And if you do not accept this crusade, then you will lose your self-righteousness and fame and commit sin."
"2.34 People, too, will recount thy everlasting dishonour; and to one who has been honoured, dishonour is worse than death.","..2.34.. And everyone will also keep talking about your long lasting bad reputation;  And for a respected man, dishonor is worse than death."
2.35 The great car-warriors will think that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear; and thou wilt be lightly held by them who have thought much of thee.,"2.35. And for those for whom you are very respectable, you will now become insignificant, those great people will consider you retired from the war out of fear."
"2.36 Thy enemies also, cavilling at thy power, will speak many abusive words. What is more painful than this?","..2.36.. Your enemies will speak many unspeakable words criticizing your strength, and what could be more painful than that?"
"2.37 Slain, thou wilt obtain heaven; victorious, thou wilt enjoy the earth; therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight.","..2.37.. By dying in battle you will attain heaven or by winning you will enjoy the earth;  Therefore, O Kaunteya! You stand up after deciding to fight."
"2.38 Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shalt not incur sin.","..2.38.. Get ready for war by equating happiness-sorrow, profit-loss and victory-defeat;  In this way you will not commit sin."
"2.39 This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdon concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action.","..2.39.. Hey Parth! You were told the knowledge related to Sankhya and now listen to the knowledge related to this (karma) yoga, with the knowledge of which you will be able to destroy the bondage of karma."
"2.40 In this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm (production of contrary results or transgression). Even a little of this knowledge (even a little practice of this Yoga) protects one from great fear.",..2.40.. There is no defect in sequence or suffix in this. Even a little practice of this religion (yoga) protects from great fear.
"2.41 Here, O joy of the Kurus, there is but a single one-pointed determination; many-branched and endless are the thoughts of the irresolute.","..2.41.. Hey Kurunandan! There is only one decisive intellect in this (subject), the intellects (resolutions) of ignorant people are many different and infinite."
"2.42 Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, taking pleasure in the eulogising words of the Vedas, O Arjuna, saying, ""There is nothing else.""","..2.42.. O Partha, the ignorant man who speaks these flowery words while enjoying the Vedas? There is nothing greater than this (heaven)."
"2.43 Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, (they utter speech which is directed to ends) leading to new births as the result of their works, and prescribe various methods abounding in specific actions, for the attainment of pleasure and power.","..2.43.. Full of desires? People who believe that heaven is the best, tell about many activities that lead to enjoyment and wealth, which (in reality) give the results of karma in the form of birth."
"2.44 For those who are attached to pleasure and power, whose minds are drawn away by such teaching, ï1thatï1 determinate reason is not formed which is steadily bent on meditation and Samadhi (superconscious state).","..2.44..Those whose mind has been taken away, such people who are attached to pleasures and luxuries do not have determined intelligence in their conscience, that is, they are not capable of practicing meditation."
"2.45 The Vedas deal with the three attributes (of Nature); be thou above these three attributes. O Arjuna, free yourself from the pairs of opposites, and ever remain in the ality of Sattva (goodness), freed from (the thought of) acisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.","..2.45.. O Arjun, the subject of the Vedas is related to the three gunas (world), are you beyond the three gunas? Uncontested? Situated in eternal sattva (purity)? Become free from Yogakshema and self-sufficient."
"2.46 To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.",..2.46.. How much use does a human being have in a small reservoir when there is abundant water from all sides? The self-enlightened Brahmin has the same purpose in all the Vedas.
"2.47 Thy right is to work only, but never with its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction.",..2.47.. Do you have the right just to do the work? Never in fruit. You should not be dependent on the results of your actions and you should not be attached to non-actions either.
"2.48 Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.","..2.48.. O Dhananjaya, abandoning attachment and being equanimous between success and failure, do your work while being situated in yoga. This equanimity is called yoga."
"2.49 Far lower than the Yoga of wisdon is action, O Arjuna. Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are they whose motive is the fruit.","..2.49.. In comparison to this Buddhiyoga, are (fruitful) actions extremely inferior? Therefore, O Dhananjaya, take refuge in your wisdom. Those who desire fruits are misers."
"2.50 Endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action.",..2.50.. Does a man with equanimity give up both virtuous and sinful actions here (in this life)? That's why you become full of yoga. Yoga is efficiency in actions.
"2.51 The wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil.","..2.51.. The wise people having the Yoga of Buddhi, renouncing the fruits of their actions and freed from the bondage of birth, attain the state of Anamaya i.e. innocent."
"2.52 When thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard.",".2.52. When your intellect will get rid of the swamp of illusion (Kalil), then you will attain detachment from all those things (detachment)? Which is worth listening to and is heard."
"2.53 When thy intellect, which is perplexed by the Veda text, which thou hast read, shall stand immovable and steady in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-realisation.","..2.53.. When your mind, which has been distracted by listening to various topics, becomes immovable and stable in the form of the Self, then you will attain (Paramarth) Yoga."
"2.54 Arjuna said  What, O Krishna, is the description of him who has steady wisdom, and is merged in the superconscious state? How does one of steady wisdom speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?","..2.54.. Arjun said - O Keshav, what are the characteristics of a man with a stable mind in samadhi? How does a man with a stable mind speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?"
"2.55 The Blessed Lord said  When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom.",..2.55.. Shri Bhagwan said – O Partha? The time when a man gives up all the desires in his mind and remains content with the soul itself? At that time he is called Sthithaprajna.
"2.56 He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures, and is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.",..2.56.. Whose mind is not disturbed in sorrow? Whose desire is quenched in happiness? Whose heart is angry with? Have fear and anger been destroyed? That sage is called Sthitapragya.
"2.57 He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, who neither rejoices not hastes, his wisdom is fixed.","..2.57.. The one who is devoid of extreme affection everywhere, neither becomes happy nor hateful after receiving those auspicious and inauspicious things? His wisdom is established (stable)."
"2.58 When, like the tortoise which withdraws on all sides its limbs, he withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, then his wisdom becomes steady.","..2.58.. Just as a tortoise gathers its body parts, in the same way does this man surround his senses from all sides with the objects of the senses? Then his intellect becomes stable."
2.59 The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man leaving the longing (behind); but his longing also turns away on seeing the Supreme.,"..2.59.. Do the desires go away from the non-vegetarian physical person? But on seeing the supreme element, there is no attachment (for them), and this (man's) attachment also goes away."
"2.60 The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise man though he be striving (to control them).","..2.60.. O Kaunteya, while striving for (restraint) these senses forcefully take away the mind of even an intelligent (Vipacchit) man."
"2.61 Having restrained them all he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control.","..2.61.. By controlling all those senses, one becomes united and intelligent. The man whose senses are under control? His wisdom is respected."
"2.62 When a man thinks of the objects, attachment for them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises.",..2.62.. Does a man who thinks about things become attached to them? From attachment comes desire and from desire comes anger.
2.63 From anger comes delusion; from delusion loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; from the destruction of discrimination he perishes.,"..2.63.. Attachment arises from anger and confusion arises from attachment. When memory gets confused, intelligence gets destroyed and due to loss of intelligence, the person gets destroyed."
"2.64 But the self-controlled man, moving among the objects with the senses under restraint and free from attraction and repulsion, attains to peace.","..2.64.. A self-controlled (vidheyatma) man, free from attachment and aversion, attains happiness (prasad) by enjoying the objects through his controlled (atmavashyai) senses."
2.65 In that peace all pains are destroyed; for the intellect of the tranil-minded soon becomes steady.,"..2.65.. On receiving Prasad, all the sorrows end and the mind of a happy person soon becomes stable."
"2.66 There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady and to the unsteady no meditation is possible, and to the unmeditative there can be no peace, and to the man who has no peace, how can there be happiness?",..2.66.. (Without restraint) An Ayukt man does not have (self) knowledge and an Ayukt man does not have the capacity for emotion and meditation. An emotionless man does not get peace. A disturbed man does not find happiness.
"2.67 For the mind, which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters.","..2.67.. Just as wind moves a boat in water, in the same way, which sense does the mind imitate in the midst of senses vying with objects? That one sense takes away his intelligence."
"2.68 Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from sense-objects.","..2.68.. Therefore? O mighty-armed man, whose senses are all under the control of the objects of the senses? His intellect is stable."
"2.69 That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man is awake; when all beings are awake, that is night for the Muni (sage) who sees.",..2.69.. The night which is there for all the lovers? In that the restrained man is awake and where all the living beings are awake? It is night for the sage who sees (the elements).
"2.70 He attains peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean which, filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the man who is full of desires.","..2.70.. Just as the waters (of many rivers) get absorbed (without disturbing it) into the ocean, which is full of unshakable prestige on all sides? Similarly, the man for whom the objects of desires get absorbed in him (without causing any disorder)? That man attains peace? Not a man who desires pleasures."
"2.71 That man attains peace who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without the sense of mine and without egoism.",..2.71.. The man who has given up all desires and is soulless? Wanders without any attachment or ego? He attains peace.
"2.72 This is the Brahmic seat (eternal state), O son of Pritha. Attaining to this, none is deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life, one attains to oneness with Brahman.","..2.72.. O Partha, this is a Brahmi situation. A man does not get fascinated after receiving this. By remaining steadfast in this faith even in the final moments, one attains Brahmanirvana (oneness with Brahma)."
"3.1 Arjuna said  If Thou thinkest that knowledge is superior to action, O Krishna, why then, O Kesava, dost Thou ask me to engage in this terrible action?","..3.1.. O Janardan, if you believe that knowledge is superior to action, then O Keshav, why do you force me into this terrible action?"
"3.2 With this apparently perplexing speech, Thou confusest, as it were, my understanding; therefore tell me that one way for certain by which I may attain bliss.","..3.2.. You fascinate my mind with this compound sentence, so please definitely tell me that one (path) by which I can attain the ultimate glory."
"3.3 The Blessed Lord said  In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one; the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogins.","..3.3.. Shri Bhagwan said, O sinless (Anagh) Arjun, in this verse, I have already mentioned two types of loyalty: that of the knowledgeable people (Sankhyaanam) through Gyan Yoga and that of the Yogis through Karma Yoga."
3.4 Not by non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection.,"..3.4.. Man does not attain renunciation by not performing deeds, nor does he attain perfection (perfection) only by renunciation of deeds."
3.5 Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for everyone is made to act helplessly indeed by the alities born of Nature.,..3.5.. No man can ever remain without doing work even for a moment because all (men) who are possessed by the qualities arising from nature are made to do work.
"3.6 He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he of deluded understanding is called a hypocrite.",..3.6.. The foolish person who controls the physical senses and keeps remembering (contemplating) the pleasures of the senses in his mind is called a liar (arrogant).
"3.7 But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels.","..3.7.. But O Arjun, the man who controls the senses through his mind and is free from attachment and practices Karma Yoga through his senses, is the best."
"3.8 Do thou perform (thy) bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction and even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for thee by inaction.","..3.8.. You do your duty because action is better than non-action. Due to your inaction, even the subsistence of (your) body will not be accomplished."
"3.9 The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment.","..3.9.. This man, engaged in any action other than the one performed for the Yagya, is bound by his actions, therefore, O Kaunteya, give up all attachment and perform the actions properly only for the sake of the Yagya."
"3.10 The Creator, having in the beginning (of creation) created mankind together with sacrifice, said, ""By this shall ye propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires (the cow which yields all the desired objects).""","..3.10.. Prajapati (Creator) created the people along with Yagya in the beginning (of creation) and said that through this Yagya, you get growth and this Yagya fulfills the desires desired for you (Ishtakamdhuk)."
"3.11 With this do ye nourish the gods and may those gods nourish you; thus nourishing one another, ye shall attain to the highest good.","..3.11.. You people should progress the gods through this yajna and those gods should progress you. By making mutual progress in this way, you will attain ultimate glory."
"3.12 The gods, nourished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. So, he who enjoys the objects given by the gods without offering (in return) to them, is verily a thief.",..3.12.. The gods nourished by the Yagya will provide you with the desired food. The man who enjoys the pleasures given by them without giving them to them is definitely a thief.
3.13 The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are freed from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food (only) for their own sake verily eat sin.,"..3.13.. The noble men who eat the leftover food from the Yagya are freed from all sins, but those who cook only for themselves, eat only sins."
3.14 From food come forth beings; from rain food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain and sacrifice is born of action.,..3.14.. All living beings are born from food. Food is born from plants. Parjanya originates from Yagya and Yagya originates from actions.
"3.15 Know thou that action comes from Brahma and Brahma comes from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervading (Brahma) ever rests in sacrifice.",..3.15.. Karma originates from Brahmaji and Brahmaji is expressed through Akshar Tattva. That is why the omnipresent Brahma is always established in Yagya.
"3.16 He who does not follow here the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Arjuna.","..3.16.. The man who does not follow the cycle thus initiated here, O Partha, that sinful man who indulges in the senses, lives his life in vain."
"3.17 But for that man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self and who is content in the Self alone, verily there is nothing to do.","..3.17.. But the person who rejoices in the soul, is satisfied in the soul and is satisfied in the soul, there is no duty for him."
3.18 For him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object.,"..3.18.. In this world, that man has no concern with action and non-action, nor does he depend on mere existence for anything."
"3.19 Therefore without attachment, do thou always perform action which should be done; for by performing action without attachment man reaches the Supreme.","..3.19.. Therefore, you should always perform your duty properly without being attached;  Because, an unattached man attains God while doing work."
3.20 Janaka and others attained perfection verily by action only; even with a view to the protection of the masses thou shouldst perform action.,..3.20.. Janakadi (knowledgeable people) also looking at the accumulation of people (people's protection) achieved through action itself;  You are capable of doing the work.
"3.21 Whatsoever a great man does, that the other men also do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world (mankind) follows.","..3.21.. Whatever a great man conducts, others also imitate him; Whatever man proves, people also follow him."
"3.22 There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that should be done by Me, nor is there anything unattained that should be attained; yet I engage Myself in action.","..3.22.. Even though I do not have any duties in the worldly world and even the slightest thing worth attaining (Avapatvyam) is not unattainable, still I behave in action only."
"3.23 For, should I not ever engage Myself in action, unwearied, men would in every way follow My path, O Arjuna.",".3.23. If I am careful (Atandritah) then perhaps I may not continue in action, O Partha! Men will follow my path in every way."
3.24 These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; I should be the author of confusion of castes and destruction of these beings.,"..3.24.. If I do not act, all these worlds will be destroyed; And I will be the creator of casteism and the destroyer of this people."
"3.25 As the ignorant men act from attachment to action, O Bharata (Arjuna), so should the wise act without attachment, wishing the welfare of the world.","..3.25.. Hey India! Just as ignorant people who are attached to work do their work, similarly a learned man should work without attachment and with the desire of public welfare."
"3.26 Let no wise man unsettle the mind of ignorant people who are attached to action; he should engage them in all actions, himself fulfilling them with devotion.",..3.26.. A knowledgeable person should not create confusion in the minds of ignorant people who are engrossed in their deeds. They themselves should conduct their deeds properly and make them do the same.
"3.27 All actions are wrought in all cases by the alities of Nature only. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks, ""I am the doer.""","..3.27.. All actions are performed by the modes of nature; the man, deluded by ego, believes, “I am the doer.”"
"3.28 But he who knows the Truth, O mighty-armed (Arjuna), about the divisions of the alities and (their) functions, knowing that the Gunas as senses move amidst the Gunas as the sense-objects, is not attached.","..3.28.. But O mighty-armed one! A wise man, who knows the truth (element) of the division of Gunas and Karmas, does not get attached (in Karma), knowing that ""Gunas interact with Gunas"" (in Karmas)."
3.29 Those deluded by the alities of Nature are attached to the functions of the alities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one who is of imperfect knowledge.,..3.29.. Men who are fascinated by the qualities of nature are attached to qualities and actions; those dull-witted men with incomplete knowledge (Akritsnavidah) should not be disturbed by men with complete knowledge.
"3.30 Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred in the Self, free from hope and egoism, and from (mental) fever, do thou fight.","..3.30.. By renouncing all actions in Me, devoid of hope and attachment, free from sorrow, fight the battle."
"3.31 Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine with faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from actions.","..3.31.. Those people who are devoid of flawed intellect (anasuyantah) and full of faith, who always follow this opinion (sermon) of mine ritually, they become free from the bondage of karma."
"3.32 But those who carp at My teaching and do not practise it, deluded of all knowledge, and devoid of discrimination, know them to be doomed to destruction.",".3.32. But those foolish people with flawed views who do not follow this opinion of mine, you should consider that those people with minds deluded in all knowledge have been destroyed."
"3.33 Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature; beings will follow Nature; what can 
restraint do?",".3.33. A wise man also tries according to his nature. All living beings follow their own nature, then what will control (of anyone) do to them."
"3.34 Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses; let none come under their sway; for, they are his foes.",..3.34.. There are passions and aversions (in the mind) towards the object of the senses (i.e. every sense);  Man should not be under the control of both of them;  Because they are his (man's) enemies.
"3.35 Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear (is productive of danger).",..3.35.. It is better to follow one's own religion without virtues than to follow another religion properly practiced;  Death in one's own religion is beneficial (but) death in other religion gives fear.
"3.36 Arjuna said  But impelled by what does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O Varshneya (Krishna), constrained as it were, by force?","..3.36.. Arjun said – O Varshneya! Then, by what inspiration does this man commit sin, despite his unwillingness as if he was forced to do so?"
"3.37 The Blessed Lord said  It is desire, it is anger both of the ality of Rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as the foe here (in this world).","..3.37.. Shri Bhagavan said – This is the 'desire' arising in Rajoguna, this is anger; This great person (who has a big appetite) and a great sinner, consider him your enemy here (in this world)."
"3.38 As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by the amnion, so is this enveloped by that.","..3.38.. Just as fire is covered by smoke and a mirror by dust and just as a fetus is covered by the uterus, so is this (knowledge) covered by that (work)."
"3.39 O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire.","..3.39.. Hey Konteya! Like fire which is difficult to satisfy, knowledge is covered by the form of lust, this eternal enemy of the wise."
"3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom.","..3.40.. The senses, mind and intellect are said to be its abodes;  This work fascinates the physical person by covering the knowledge through them."
"3.41 Therefore, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation.","..3.41.. Therefore, O Arjun! You first control your senses and destroy this evil destroyer of knowledge and science."
3.42 They say that the senses are superior (to the body); superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; one who is superior even to the intellect is He (the Self).,"..3.42.. Beyond (the body) are called the (superior) senses;  Beyond the senses is the mind and beyond the mind is the intellect, and that which is beyond the intellect is the soul."
"3.43 Thus knowing Him Who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to coner.","..3.43.. In this way, knowing the (pure) soul beyond the intellect and controlling the soul (mind) through the soul (intellect), O mighty-armed one! You kill this formidable (Durasadam) enemy of Kamarupa."
4.1 The Blessed Lord said  I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku.,..4.1.. Sri Bhagavan said --- I told (taught) this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan (Sun God);  Vivasvan said to Manu;  Manu said to Ikshvaku.
"4.2 This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by long lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa (burner of the foes).","..4.2.. In this way, the royal sages came to know this yoga received through tradition, (but) O Parantap! That yoga got destroyed here (in this world) after a long time."
"4.3 That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for thou art My devotee and My friend; it is the supreme secret.",..4.3.. I told (taught) this ancient yoga to you today because you are my devotee and friend. This is a great secret.
"4.4 Arjuna said  Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to understand that Thou taughtest this Yoga in the beginning?","..4.4.. Arjun said - Your birth is after (after) and Vivasvan's birth is before (yours), therefore how should I know that you had said (this yoga) in the beginning (of creation)?"
"4.5 The Blessed Lord said  Many births of Mine have passed as well as of thine, O Arjuna; I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa (scorcher of foes).","..4.5.. Lord Shri said - Oh Arjun! You and I have had many births, (but) O Parantap! I know them all and you don't."
"4.6 Though I am unborn, of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing My own Nature, I am born by My own Maya.","..4.6.. Although I am an unborn and imperishable form and am the God of all existence, (yet) by keeping my nature under my control (Adhishthaya), I take birth from my Maya."
"4.7 Whenever there is decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then I manifest Myself.","..4.7.. Hey India! Whenever there is loss of righteousness and increase of unrighteousness, I reveal Myself."
"4.8 For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked and for the establishment of righteousness, I am born in every age.","..4.8.. For the protection of virtuous people, the destruction of evildoers, and the establishment of religion, I appear in every age."
"4.9 He who thus know, in their true light, My divine birth and action, having abandoned the body, is not born again, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.","..4.9.. Hey Arjun! My birth and actions are divine, thus the man who knows the principle does not take birth again after leaving the body;  Only I get it."
"4.10 Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being.","..4.10.. Many men who have taken refuge in me with a mind free from attachment, fear and anger, have attained my form, purified by penance in the form of knowledge."
"4.11 In whatever way men approach Me even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna.","..4.11.. Those who worship Me, I show my grace to them;  O Partha, all men follow my path in every way."
4.12 Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods; because success is ickly attained by men through action.,"..4.12.. (Ordinary humans) here (in this world) worship the gods, desiring the fruits of their actions;  Because in the human world the fruits of one's actions are achieved soon."
4.13 The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma; though I am the author thereof know Me as non-doer and immutable.,"..4.13.. Chaturvanya has been composed by me from the department of qualities and actions. Although I am its doer, yet you know me as non-doer and imperishable."
"4.14 Actions do not taint Me, nor have I a desire for the fruit of actions. He who knows Me thus is not bound by actions.","..4.14.. Karmas do not indulge me;  Nor am I interested in the fruits of my actions. In this way, one who knows me is also not bound by deeds."
"4.15 Having known this, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action; therefore do thou also perform action, as did the ancients in days of yore.","..4.15.. Even the ancient men of the past have performed their actions with this knowledge;  Therefore, you too should always perform the same actions done by your ancestors."
"4.16 What is action? What is inaction? As to this even the wise are confused. Therefore I shall teach thee such action (the nature of action and inaction) by knowing which thou shalt be liberated from the evil (of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death).","..4.16.. What is karma and what is non-action? Even intelligent people get confused in this matter. That's why I will tell you karma, (that is, I will explain the nature of action and non-action) knowing which you will be free from inauspicious (worldly bondage)."
"4.17 For verily (the true nature) of action (enjoined by the scriptures) should be known, also (that) 
of forbidden (or unlawful) action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature (path) of action.",..4.17.. One should know the nature of one's actions and one should also know the nature of one's vices; (Boddhavyam) and also the nature of non-action should be known (because) the speed of action is deep.
"4.18 He who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a Yogi and performer of all actions.","..4.18.. The man who sees inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men, he is a yogi who performs complete actions."
"4.19 He whose undertakings are all devoid of desires and (selfish) purposes and whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge,  him the wise call a sage.","..4.19.. A person whose actions are free from desire and determination, whose actions are burnt by the fire of knowledge, is called a knowledgeable scholar."
"4.20 Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of the action, ever content, depending on nothing, he does not do anything though engaged in activity.","..4.20.. The man who, having given up the desire for action, is eternally satisfied and devoid of all shelter, does nothing (actually) even though he is engaged in action."
"4.21 Without hope and with the mind and the self controlled, having abandoned all covetousness, doing mere bodily action, he incurs no sin.","..4.21.. One who is free from hope and who has controlled the mind and soul (body), who has renounced all attachments, such a person does not commit sin even while performing physical activities."
"4.22 Content with what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposites and envy, even-minded in success and failure, though acting, he is not bound.","..4.22.. A man who is content with whatever he gets as per his own will, free from conflicts and desires, and equanimous between success and failure, does not get bound even by doing work."
"4.23 To one who is devoid of attchment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, who works for the sake of sacrifice (for the sake of God), the whole action is dissolved.","..4.23.. All the deeds of a person who is free from attachment and free, whose mind is situated in knowledge, who conducts the yagya are absorbed."
4.24 Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in action.,"..4.24.. Arpan (i.e. the means of offering, Shruva) is Brahma and Havi (Shakalya or liquid capable of being offered as Havan) is also Brahma;  The havan performed by the doer in the form of Brahma in the fire of Brahma is also Brahma. In this way, the destination of the person who is in samadhi in the form of Brahma is also Brahma."
4.25 Some Yogies perform sacrifice to the gods alone; while others (who have realised the Self) offer the self as sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman alone.,..4.25.. Some yogis only perform Yagya in the form of worship of Gods; And others (knowledgeable people) perform Yagya through Yagya in the fire of Brahma.
4.26 Some again offer the organ of hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses.,"..4.26.. Others (yogis) offer all the senses in the fire of restraint, and others (people) offer the objects of speech in the fire of the senses."
4.27 Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath (vital energy or Prana) in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint kindled by knowledge.,..4.27.. Others (yogis) sacrifice the actions of all the senses and the soul in the fire of self-control and yoga illuminated by knowledge.
"4.28 Others again offer wealth, austerity and Yoga as sacrifice, while the ascetics of self-restraint and rigid vows offer study of scriptures and knowledge as sacrifice.","..4.28.. Some (seekers) are the ones who perform Dravya Yagya, Tapayagya and Yoga Yagya;  And others are the yogis who observe difficult fasts, do self-study and perform knowledge yagya."
"4.29 Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the outgoing, restraining the course of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the restraint of the breath.","..4.29.. Others (yogis) sacrifice Pranavayu in Apanavayu, and sacrifice Apana in Prana. By stopping the movement of Prana and Apana, they consider it to be the same as Pranayama."
"4.30 Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in life-breaths. All these are knowers of sacrifice, whose sins are destroyed by sacrifice.","..4.30.. Others, those who eat regularly (meditational people) perform havan in their lives. All of them are the ones who know Yagya, whose sins have been destroyed by Yagya."
"4.31 Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for the man who does not perform sacrifice; how then can he have the other, O Arjuna?","..4.31.. Oh best of Kurus! Those who enjoy the residual nectar of Yagya attain eternal Brahma. A man without Yagya does not even get this world, then how will he get the next world?"

Many types of such yagyas are spread in the mouth of Brahma i.e. the Vedas i.e. they are described. Know all of them to be born out of karma;  Knowing this way you will become free.
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"..4.33.. Hey Parantap! The yagya of knowledge is better than the yagya performed with liquids. Hey Parth! All actions end in knowledge, that is, knowledge is their culmination."
"4.34 Know That by long prostration, by estion and by service; the wise who have realised the Truth will instruct thee in (that) knowledge.","..4.34.. Know that (knowledge) by (going near the Guru), prostrating, asking questions and doing service;  These philosophical wise men will preach knowledge to you."
"4.35 Knowing ï1thatï1 thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again get deluded like this; and by that thou shalt see all beings in thy Self and also in Me.","..4.35.. Knowing this you will never again be tempted like this, and O Pandava! Through which you will see the ghost in your self and also in me."
"4.36 Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt verily cross all sins by the raft of knowledge.","..4.36.. Even if you are the one who commits more sins than all the other sinners, then by the boat of knowledge, you will definitely get rid of all the sins."
"4.37 As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.","..4.37.. Just as a burning fire consumes fuel, so too, O Arjun! The fire of knowledge burns all the deeds to ashes."
"4.38 Verily, there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga finds it in the Self in time.","..4.38.. There is, undoubtedly, nothing in this world as purifying as knowledge. A man accomplished in Yoga himself attains it in the soul at the appropriate time."
"4.39 The man who is full of faith, who is devoted to it, and who has subdued the senses obtains (this) knowledge; and having obtained the knowledge he attains at once to the supreme peace.","..4.39.. A man who is faithful, ready and alert attains knowledge. After attaining knowledge he soon attains ultimate peace."

The ignorant, faithless and doubtful man gets destroyed, (among them too) for the doubtful man there is neither this world, nor the next world, nor happiness."

Therefore, by cutting the self-doubt arising from ignorance in your heart with the sword of knowledge, O Bharat! Stand up with the help of yoga."
"5.1 Arjuna said  Renunciation of actions, O Krishna, Thou praisest, and again Yoga. Tell me conclusively that which is the better of the two.",..5.1.. Arjun said - Krishna! You praise renunciation of actions and then yoga (conduct of action). Tell me which one is definitely better among these two.
"5.2 The Blessed Lord said  Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.","5.2. Shri Bhagwan said - Renunciation of Karma and Karmayoga both are extremely beneficial;  But among both of them, Karmayoga is better than Sannyasa."
"5.3 He should be known as a perpertual Sannyasi who neither hates nor desires; for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily set free from bondage.","5.3. The man who neither hates anyone nor desires anyone, is always considered a Sanyasi;  Because, O mighty-armed one! A man free from conflicts easily becomes free from bondage."
"5.4 Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action or the performance of action as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one obtains the fruits of both.","5.4. Children, i.e. people of childlike mind consider Sankhya (Sanyas) and Yoga as different from each other;  A person properly established in either one attains the fruits of both."
"5.5 That place which is reached by the Sankhyas or the Jnanis is reached by the Yogis (Karma Yogis). He sees, who sees knowledge and the performance of action (Karma Yoga) as one.","..5.5.. The place which is attained by the wise, the Karma Yogis also reach the same place. Therefore the man who sees Sankhya and Yoga (in effect) as one and the same, sees the same (in reality)."
"5.6 But renunciation, O mighty-armed Arjuna, is hard to attain without Yoga; the Yoga-harmonised sage ickly goes to Brahman.","5.6. But, O mighty-armed one! It is difficult to attain sannyasa without yoga;  A person who meditates with yoga soon attains God."
"5.7 He who is devoted to the path of action, whose mind is ite pure, who has conered the self, who has subdued his senses and who realises his Self as the Self in all beings, though acting, is not tainted.","5.7. The man who is engaged in Yoga, has a pure conscience, has controlled the body, has experienced unity with the senses and the soul situated in the physical world, does not get attached to them even while doing work."
"5.8 ""I do nothing at all,"" thus would the harmonised knower of Truth think  seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing.","5.8. A man having Tattva-Vitta will think (i.e. know) that “I do not do even the slightest action” while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing."

"5.10 He who does actions, offering them to Brahman, and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, just as a lotus-leaf is not tainted by water.","..5.10.. The man who performs all his actions by offering them to Brahma and renouncing attachment, is not indulged in sins like a lotus leaf."
"5.11 Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body, mind, intellect, and even by the senses, for the purification of the self.","5.11. Yogis work for self-purification (purification of mind) by renouncing attachments through body, mind, intellect and senses."
"5.12 The united one (the well poised or the harmonised) having abandoned the fruit of action attains to the eternal peace: the non-united only (the unsteady or the unbalanced) impelled by desire, attached to the fruit, is bound.",5.12. A wise man attains ultimate peace by renouncing the fruits of his actions;  And the uneducated man becomes attached to the fruit and becomes bound by desire.
"5.13 Mentally renouncing all actions and self-controlled, the embodied one rests happily in the nine-gated city, neither acting nor causing others (body and senses) to act.","..5.13.. Having renounced all actions from the mind, a man of self-control neither does nor gets any action done, while living happily in the city of the body with Navdwar."

"5.15 The Lord takes neither the demerit nor even the merit of any; knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, thery beings are deluded.","5.15. Vibhu Parmatma neither accepts anyone's sinful deeds nor virtuous deeds;  (But) knowledge is covered by ignorance, and all living beings are deluded by it."
"5.16 But to those whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self, like the sun, knowledge reveals the Supreme (Brahman).","..5.16.. But for those whose ignorance is destroyed by self-knowledge, that knowledge, like the sun, illuminates God."
"5.17 Their intellect absorbed in That, their self being That, established in That, with That for their supreme goal, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by knowledge.","..5.17.. Those whose intelligence is situated in Him (God), whose mind is transformed, who have faith in Him, whose ultimate goal is He (Brahm), through knowledge the sinless persons attain non-rebirth, i.e. they are not reborn. ."
"5.18 Sages look with an eal eye on a Brahmana endowed with learning and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, and even on a dog and an outcaste.","..5.18.. (Such are those) who see the same principle in the learned Brahmins endowed with knowledge and modesty, and also in the cows, elephants, dogs and Chandalas."
5.19 Even here (in this world) birth (everything) is overcome by those whose minds rest in eality; Brahman is spotless indeed and eal; therefore they are established in Brahman.,"..5.19.. Those whose mind is situated in equanimity, this chapter is conquered by them; Because Brahma is innocent and equal, hence they are situated in Brahma only."
"5.20 Resting in Brahman, with steady intellect and undeluded, the knower of Brahman neither rejoiceth on obtaining what is pleasant nor grieveth on obtaining what is unpleasant.","..5.20.. The man with stable intellect, who is free from illusion and is situated in Brahman, does not become happy after getting what he likes and does not get disturbed after getting what is unpleasant."
5.21 With the self unattached to external contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in    the meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness.,5.21. A man whose conscience is free from attachment to external things attains happiness in the soul itself;  A man whose mind is absorbed in the meditation of Brahma attains eternal happiness.
"5.22 The enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for they have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna; the wise man does not rejoice in them.","..5.22.. O Kaunteya, the pleasures that arise from the combination (of senses and objects) are the cause of sorrow, because they have a beginning and an end. An intelligent man does not enjoy them."
"5.23 He who is able, while still here (in this world) to withstand, before the liberation from the body, the impulse born out of desire and anger  he is a Yogi, he is a happy man.","..5.23.. The man who is capable of bearing the passions arising out of lust and anger even before leaving his body in this world, is a yogi and a happy man."

Those sages attain salvation - those whose sins have been destroyed, who have no doubt, are self-controlled and are happy only in the welfare of the world."

Keeping external objects outside, placing the vision of the eyes in the middle of the eyebrows and equalizing the prana and apanavayu circulating in the nostrils."
"5.28 With the senses, the mind and the intellect (ever) controlled, having liberation as his supreme goal, free from desire, fear and anger  the sage is verily liberated for ever.","..5.28.. The man whose senses, mind and intellect are controlled, such a sage devoted to salvation, who is free from desire, fear and anger, is always free."

(Sadhak Devotee) One attains peace by knowing that I am the enjoyer of Yagya and penance, the great God of all the worlds and the friend of every living being."
6.1 The Blessed Lord said  He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions  he is a Sannyasi and a Yogi; not he who is without fire and without action.,"6.1. Sri Bhagavan said - The man who performs his duties without being dependent on the results of his actions, is a Sanyasi and a Yogi, and not the one who has renounced only fire and activities."
"6.2 Do thou, O Arjuna, know Yoga to be that which they call renunciation; no one verily becomes a Yogi who has not renounced thoughts.","6.2. Hey Pandava! What is called (scripturally) renunciation, you should consider it as yoga; Because no man is a yogi who does not give up his resolutions."
"6.3 For a sage who wishes to attain to Yoga, action is said to be the means; for the same sage who has attained to Yoga, inaction (iescence) is said to be the means.","6.3. For a sage who wishes to become established in Yoga, doing work is said to be the means and for the same person after becoming established in Yoga, Sham (peace, resolution and renunciation) is said to be the means."
"6.4 When a man is not attached to the sense-objects or to actions, having renounced all thoughts, then he is said to have attained to Yoga.","..6.4.. When (the seeker) is neither attached to the objects of the senses nor to the actions, then the sannyasi of all resolutions is called Yogarudha."
"6.5 One should raise oneself by one's Self alone; let not one lower oneself; for the Self alone is the friend of oneself, and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself.",6.5. Man must save himself by himself and not degrade himself; Because the soul itself is the soul's friend and the soul (man himself) is the soul's (own) enemy.
"6.6 The Self is the friend of the self of him by whom the self has been conered by the Self, but to the unconered self, this Self stands in the position of an enemy, like an (external) foe.","..6.6.. One who has conquered the soul (senses, etc.) through the soul, the soul is his friend, but for the Ajitendriya, the soul is like an enemy."
"6.7 The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful is balanced in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as also in honour and dishonour.","6.7. For such a Jitatma Purusha who remains calm in cold-heat, happiness-sorrow and honor-insult, God is situated in the right way, that is, present in the form of self."
"6.8 The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom (of the Self), who has conered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonied (i.e., is said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi).","6.8. The Yogi who is satisfied with knowledge and science, who is free from vices (Kutastha) and has good senses, who is equal to mud, stone and pebbles, is called one who is united (with God)."

A yogi who has controlled his body and mind should remain alone in a secluded place, free from hopes and attachments, and should constantly stabilize his mind in the soul."
"6.11 In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of a cloth, a skin and Kusa-grass, one over the other.","6.11. In a pure land, you have kept kush, mrigashala and clothes on it, by making your seat stable neither too high nor too low….॥॥."

(The seeker) should sit with a peaceful conscience, fearlessness and established in the vow of celibacy, controlling the mind and concentrating the mind on me, considering me as the ultimate goal."
"6.15 Thus always keeping the mind balanced, the Yogi, with the mind controlled, attains to the peace abiding in Me, which culminates in liberation.","6.15. In this way, the yogi with a controlled mind, always trying to stabilize the mind, attains peace in the form of ultimate nirvana (salvation) situated in me."
"6.16 Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is (always) awake, O Arjuna.","..6.16.. But, O Arjun! This yoga is not possible for a man who eats too much or does not eat at all and who sleeps a lot or is always awake."
"6.17 Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation (such 
as walking, etc.), who is moderate in exertion in actions, who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness.","6.17. Yoga is the destroyer of sorrows for that person who has proper diet and exercise, makes the right efforts and has limited sleep and wakefulness."
"6.18 When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self only, free from longing for all the objects of desires, then it is said, 'He is united'.","..6.18.. The period when the controlled mind becomes established in its own form and becomes free from all objects, at that time he is called a Yogi."
"6.19 As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker  to such is compared the Yogi of controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self (or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self).","..6.19.. Just as the flame of a lamp situated in a place of vibrationless air becomes free from desires, a similar analogy has been given to the mind of a yogi with yatchitta while practicing yoga."
"6.20 When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga attains to quietude and when seeing the Self by the self, he is satisfied in his own Self.","..6.20.. By practicing Yoga, the restrained mind becomes free and the state in which one becomes satisfied with oneself by looking at oneself."
"6.21 When he (the Yogi) feels that Infinite Bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect and which transcends the senses, and established wherein he never moves from the Reality.","..6.21.. The state in which he experiences the happiness which is ultimate, supersensuous and buddhigraham and in the happiness in which he is situated, this meditative yogi never gets distracted from the element again."
"6.22 Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein estabished, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.","6.22. On attaining the benefit, he cannot accept any other benefit greater than that and when he is established in it, he is not disturbed even by great sorrow."
"6.23 Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practised with determination and with an undesponding mind.","..6.23.. There is separation from the combination of sorrow, that should be known by the name 'Yoga'. (The yoga which is the goal of Dhyanayoga) should be practiced with determination and without getting tired."

By completely renouncing all the desires arising from the resolution, by properly controlling the senses from all sides through the mind."
"6.25 Little by little let him attain to ietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything.",..6.25.. Gradually (Yogi) may attain Uparamta (peace) through a patient intellect;  Keep the mind situated in the soul and then do not think about anything else.
"6.26 From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.","..6.26.. Control this fickle and unstable mind due to the reasons due to which it wanders (about subjects), bring it under the control of the soul itself, that is, make it stable in the soul."
"6.27 Supreme Bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is ite peaceful, whose passion is ieted, who has become Brahman and who is free from sin.","..6.27.. One whose mind is peaceful, who is sinless (Akalmasham) and whose Rajoguna (Viksepa) has been calmed, such a Yogi who is in the form of Brahma, attains supreme happiness."
"6.28 The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of Yoga), freed from sins, easily enjoys the Infinite Bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).","..6.28.. In this way, a sinless yogi who always practices the yoga of fixing the mind in the soul happily attains the ultimate happiness of contact with Brahma."
6.29 With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.,..6.29.. A yogi who has a yogic heart and is omniscient sees the soul in all beings and only the ghosts in the soul.

"6.31 He who, being established in unity, worships Me Who dwells in all beings, that Yogi abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living.","..6.31.. The man who worships me, situated in the feeling of oneness, who is present in all the beings, is a yogi who remains situated in me, acting (living) in every way."
"6.32 He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees eality everywhere, be it pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi.","..6.32.. Hey Arjun! The man who sees everything as equal to himself, be it happiness or sorrow, is considered the ultimate yogi."
"6.33 Arjuna said  This Yoga of eanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance, because of the restlessness (of the mind).","..6.33.. Arjun said – O Madhusudan! This Samya Yoga which you said, I do not see its permanent state because of the fickleness of the mind."
"6.34 The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna: I deem it as difficult to control it as to control the wind.",..6.34.. Because O Krishna! This mind is of fickle and restless nature and is strong and firm; I consider it to be as difficult as air to control it.
"6.35 The Blessed Lord said  Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained.","..6.35.. Shri Bhagavan says – O beloved ones! Undoubtedly the mind is fickle and difficult to control; But, O son of Kunti! It can be controlled through practice and renunciation."
"6.36 I think Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self, but the self-controlled and striving one can attain to it by the (proper) means.","..6.36.. It is difficult for a man with an uncontrollable mind to attain Yoga, but it is possible for a man with an independent mind to attain Yoga through some means, this is my opinion."
"6.37 Arjuna said  He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, mee,t O Krishna?","..6.37.. Arjun said – O Krishna! What speed does such a man with incomplete efforts (Ayati) whose mind has become active through Yoga, achieve without attaining the success of Yoga?"
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"..6.38.. Oh dear ones! Doesn't that man, deluded and without shelter in the path of Brahma, get corrupted from both sides like a scattered cloud and gets destroyed?"
"6.39 This doubt of mine, O Krishna, do Thou dispel completely; because it is not possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt.",..6.39.. Hey Krishna! You are the only one capable of completely resolving this doubt of mine; Because it is not possible to find anyone other than you who can pierce this doubt.
"6.40 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none, verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief.",..6.40.. Lord Shri said - O Partha! That man is destroyed neither in this world nor in the next world; Oh father! No one who does any good deed gets into trouble.
"6.41 Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there for everlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is rorn in a house of the pure and wealthy.","..6.41.. A person who has lost his yoga after reaching the worlds of virtuous people, resides there for a long time and takes birth in the house of rich people with pure conduct."
6.42 Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to obtain in this world.,"..6.42.. Or, (the seeker) is born in a family of knowledgeable yogis, but this type of birth is undoubtedly very rare in this world."
"6.43 Thee he comes in touch with the knowledge acired in his former body and strives more than before for perfection, O Arjuna.","..6.43.. Hey Kurunandan! That person, being enriched with the knowledge acquired there in the previous body, makes even more efforts for the attainment of Yoga."
6.44 By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely wishes to know Yoga goes beyond the Brahmic word.,..6.44.. Because of that rehearsal he gets attracted towards Avash Hua Yoga. Only the one who is curious about Yoga transcends Shabda-Brahma.
"6.45 But the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually through many births, reaches the highest goal.",..6.45.. But a Yogi who practices diligently and gets purified from all sins and becomes perfect through many births (Shanai: Shanai:) then attains the supreme state.
"6.46 The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge (obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna.","..6.46.. Because a Yogi is superior to the ascetics and is considered superior to those who have knowledge (only of the scriptures) and is superior to those who do good deeds, therefore O Arjun, become a Yogi."
"6.47 And among all the Yogis he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me, worships Me is deemed by Me to be the most devout.","..6.47.. Among all the yogis, any devout yogi who worships me with his inner soul united in me (i.e. with a sense of unity) is considered the most adept (best) by me."
"7.1 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, hear how you shall without doubt know Me fully, with the mind intent on Me, practising Yoga and taking refuge in Me.","..7.1.. Hey Parth! Listen to me, with your mind unattached to me and by practicing yoga while being dependent on alcohol, how you will know me completely, without any doubt."
"7.2 I shall declare to thee in full this knowledge combined with realisation, after knowing which nothing more here remains to be known.","7.2. I will tell you this knowledge along with science in full form, knowing which nothing else is left worth knowing here (in the world)."
"7.3 Among thousands of men, one perchance strives for perfection; even among those successful strivers, only one perchance knows Me in essence.","7.3. Among thousands of human beings, only one person strives for perfection and even among those striving seekers, only one person knows me from the essence."
"7.4 Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism  thus is My Nature divided eightfold.","7.4. Earth, water, fire, air and sky and mind, intellect and ego - this is my nature divided into eight types."
"7.5 This is the inferior Prakriti, O mighty-armed (Arjuna); know thou as different from it My higher Prakriti (Nature), the very life-element, by which this world is upheld.","7.5. Oh great arms! This is placental nature. Apart from this, know my supernature in the form of a living being, by which this world is sustained."
7.6 Know that these two (Natures) are the womb of all beings. So I am the source and dissolution of the whole universe.,..7.6.. Know that all beings originate from both these natures. (Therefore) I am the place of origin and destruction of the entire world.
"7.7 There is nothing whatsoever higher than Me, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as clusters of gems on a string.",..7.7.. Hey Dhananjay! There is no other thing that is superior (beyond) me. This entire world is strung in me like beads in a thread.
"7.8 I am the sapidity in water, O Arjuna; I am the light in the moon and the sun; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in ether and virility in men.","..7.8.. Hey Konteya! I am the essence in water, I am light in the moon and the sun, I am the energy in all the Vedas, I am the sound in the sky and I am the manliness in men."
"7.9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the brilliance in the fire, the life in all beings, and I am the austerity in ascetics.",7.9. I am pure fragrance in the earth and bright in fire; I am life in all beings and I am penance in ascetics.
"7.10 Know Me, O Arjuna, as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intelligence of the intelligent; the splendour of the splendid objects am I.",7.10. Hey Parth! Know me as the eternal seed (cause) of all beings; I am the wisdom of the wise and the brightness of the brilliant.
"7.11 Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in (all) beings, I am the desire unopposed to Dharma, O Arjuna.","..7.11.. O great Bharat! I am the power of the strong, devoid of desires and attachments, and among all the beings, I am the work that is not against the religion, i.e. is favorable."
"7.12 Whatever beings (and objects) that are pure, active and inert, know that they proceed from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them.","7.12. Whatever sattvik (pure), rajasik (active) and tamasik (inanimate) emotions, know them all to have originated from me; Yet I am not in them, they are in me."
7.13 Deluded by these Natures (states or things) composed of the three alities of Nature all this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable.,"..7.13.. The whole world (people) is fascinated by these emotions (disorders) arising from the three gunas. Beyond these (gunas), the indivisible form does not know me."
"7.14 Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, made up of the (three) alities (of Nature) is difficult to cross over; those who take refuge in Me alone, cross over this illusion.",7.14. This divine triune Maya of mine is a great enemy. But those who take refuge in me transcend this illusion.
7.15 The evil-doers and the deluded who are the lowest of men do not seek Me; they whose knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons.,"..7.15.. Evildoers, fools and unrighteous people do not worship me; Those whose knowledge has been taken away by Maya, continue to hold demonic feelings."
"7.16 Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna, and they are the distressed, the seekr of knowledge, the seekr of wealth and the wise, O lord of the Bharatas.","..7.16.. O great Arjun of Bharat! Four types of people worship me: those who do good deeds (Sukritin:) the artful, the inquisitive, the well-meaning and the knowledgeable."
"7.17 Of them the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels (is the best); for I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me.","..7.17.. Among them too, the wise man with daily and undivided devotion is superior to me, because I am very dear to the wise man and he is very dear to me."
"7.18 Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in mind he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.","..7.18.. (Although) all these are excellent, but it is my opinion that the knowledgeable person is my form, because that stable intellect of the knowledgeable person is well established in me in the form of the most excellent movement."
"7.19 At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vaasudeva (the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.","..7.19.. At the end of many births (in a particular birth) after attaining the knowledge that 'all this is Vasudev', I become a knowledgeable devotee; Such a Mahatma is very rare."
"7.20 Those whose wisdom has been rent away by this or that desire, go to other gods, following this or that rite, led by their own nature.","..7.20.. Those people whose knowledge has been taken away by the desire of special enjoyment, such people, inspired by their nature, worship other gods following specific rules."
7.21 Whatsoever form any devotee desires to worship with faith  that (same) faith of his I make firm and unflinching.,"..7.21.. Whichever form (of God) the devotee wants to worship with devotion, I establish the faith of that (devotee) towards that God only."
"7.22 Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that (form) and from it he obtains his desire, these being verily ordained by Me (alone).",..7.22.. He (the devotee) worships that deity with that faith and without any doubt gets the desired pleasures prescribed by me.
"7.23 Verily the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me.",..7.23.. But the fruit of those people with less intelligence is perishable. The worshipers of the gods are attained by the gods and my devotees are attained by me only.
"7.24 The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My higher, immutable and most excellent nature.","..7.24.. Unintelligent people, without knowing My Anuttama (best) Avyaya Param Bhava, consider Me the Avyakta as the Manifest."
"7.25 I am not manifest to all (as I am) veiled by the Yoga-Maya. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable.","..7.25.. Covered with my Yogamaya, I am not visible to everyone. This deluded world (man) does not know me, the birthless, imperishable one."
"7.26 I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present and the future, but no one knows Me.","..7.26.. Hey Arjun! I know all that has happened in the past, is present in the present and will happen in the future, but no man knows me."
"7.27 By the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Bharata, all beings are subject to delusion at birth, O Parantapa.","..7.27.. Oh great India! Due to conflict and attachment arising from desire and hatred, one attains delusion (indiscretion) during the time of mere birth."
"7.28 But those men of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, and who are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me, steadfast in their vows.","..7.28.. But the virtuous people whose sins have been destroyed, those free from conflict and determination, worship me."
"7.29 Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, realise in full ï1thatï1 Brahman, the whole knowledge of the Self and all action.","..7.29.. Those who surrender to me and try to get freedom from death and death, those people know that Brahma, complete spirituality and complete action."
"7.30 Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta (pertaining to the elements), Adhidaiva (pertaining to the gods) and the Adhiyajna (pertaining to the sacrifice) know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in mind.","..7.30.. Those men who know me along with Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva and Adhiyagya, those men with wise minds know me even in the last moments."
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"8.1. Arjun said - Oh great man! What is that Brahma? What is spirituality? And what is karma? And what is said by the name Adhibhuta? And what is said by the name Adhidaiva,"
"8.2 Who and how is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu (Krishna)? And how at the time of death, art Thou to be known by the self-controlled?","8.2. And oh Madhusudan! Who is Adhiyagya here? And how is he in this body? And how are you known in the end times by moderate minded people,"
"8.3 The Blessed Lord said  Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; Its essential nature is called Self-knowledge; the offering (to the gods) which causes existence and manifestation of beings and which also sustains them is called action.","8.3. Sri Bhagavan said – The ultimate Akshar (imperishable) element is Brahma; Nature (one's own form) is called spirituality; The Visarga (sacrifice, motive force) that generates the emotions of the ghosts is known as Karma."
"8.4 Adhibhuta (knowledge of the elements) pertains to My perishable Nature and the Purusha or the Soul is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the embodied (men).","..8.4.. O Arjun, the best among bodily beings! The mortal thing (Panchamahabhoota) is Adhibhuta and Purusha Adhidaiva; I am the master in this body."
"8.5 And whosoever, leaving the body, goes forth remembering Me alone, at the time of death, he attains My Being: there is no doubt about this.","..8.5.. And whoever leaves his body remembering Me in his last moments attains My form, there is no doubt in this."
"8.6 Whosoever at the end leaves the body, thinking of any being, to that being only does he go, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), because of his constant thought of that being.","8.6. Hey Konteya! Whatever feeling (this living being) remembers when he leaves his body at the last moment, he always attains the same feeling as a result of thinking about that feeling."
"8.7 Therefore at all times remember Me only and fight. With mind and intellect fixed (or absorbed) in Me, thou shalt doubtessly come to Me alone.","8.7. Therefore, remember me constantly in all times; And fight with your mind and intellect dedicated to me, you will undoubtedly attain me."
"8.8 With the mind not moving towards any other thing, made steadfast by the method of habitual meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person, the Resplendent, O Arjuna.","..8.8.. Hey Parth! One who constantly thinks with a mind that does not go anywhere else, with the practice of yoga, attains the supreme divine person."
"8.9 Whosoever meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler (of the whole world), minuter than an atom, the supporter of all, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun and beyond the darkness of ignorance.","..8.9.. One who remembers the man who is omniscient, ancient (Puraan), controller of all, subtler than the subtle, material of all, unthinkable, form of light like the sun and (Avidya) beyond darkness."
"8.10 At the time of death, with unshaken mind, endowed with devotio, by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole life-breath in the middle of the two eyrows, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person.","..8.10.. He (the seeker) at the end of his life, with the power of yoga, properly establishes his Prana between the eyebrows and with a calm mind, filled with devotion, attains that supreme divine person."
"8.11 That which is declared Imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the self-controlled (ascetics or Sannyasins) and passion-free enter, that desiring which celibacy is practised  that goal I will declare to thee in brief.",8.11. Scholars who know the Vedas call it Akshar; In which diligent men without attachment enter; I will briefly tell you about the goal due to whose wish (the devotees) follow celibacy.
"8.12 Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart and fixed the life-breath in the head, engaged in the practice of concentration.","8.12. By controlling all the doors (of the senses), stabilizing the mind in the heart and establishing the life force in the head, he became established in Yogadharana."
"8.13 Uttering the one-syllabled Om  the Brahman  and remembering Me, he who departs, leaving the body, attains to the Supreme Goal.","8.13. The person who leaves his body while reciting this one syllable 'Om', Brahma and remembering me, attains the supreme state."
"8.14 I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me (for a long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single mind or one-pointed mind), O Partha (Arjuna).","..8.14.. Hey Parth! I am easily accessible to the daily yogi who remembers me with a single mind, that is, I am easily attained."
"8.15 Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth (here) which is the place of pain 
and is non-eternal: they have reached the highest perfection (liberation).","..8.15.. The great souls who have attained supreme success, after attaining me, do not get rebirth in the homely form of eternal sorrow."
"8.16 (All) the worlds including the world of Brahma are subject to return again, O Arjuna; but he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rirth.","..8.16.. Hey Arjun! Everyone up to Brahma Loka is of reclusive nature. But, O Kaunteya! There is no rebirth after attaining me."
"8.17 Those people who know the day of Brahma which is of a duration of a thousand Yugas (ages) and the night which is also of a thousand Yugas duration, they know day and night.","..8.17.. Those who know the duration of one day of Lord Brahma which is of a thousand years and know the duration of a night of one thousand years, they are the men who know the day and night."
8.18 From the Unmanifested all the manifested (worlds) proceed at the coming of the 'day'; at the coming of the 'night' they dissolve verily into ï1thatï1 alone which is called the Unmanifested.,"..8.18.. When (Brahmaji's) day rises, from the unexpressed (this) manifest (charachar world) arises; And on the arrival of (Brahmaji's) night, he gets absorbed in the same unmanifested."
"8.19 This same multitude of beings, being born again and again, is dissolved, helplessly, O Arjuna (into the Unmanifested) at the coming of the night and comes forth at the coming of the day.","..8.19.. Hey Parth! It is this ghost community, which is born again and again and gets absorbed. Avash Hua (this ghost village) disappears with the arrival of night and manifests with the rise of day."
"8.20 But verily there exists, higher than this Unmanifested, another unmanifested Eternal, which is not destroyed when all beings are destroyed.","..8.20.. But beyond that unmanifested thing, the other eternal unmanifested feeling does not get destroyed even after the destruction of all the ghosts."
"8.21 What is called the Unmanifested and the Imperishable, That they say is the highest goal. They who reach It do not return (to this Samsara). That is My highest abode (place or state).","..8.21.. The latent letter which has been said is the ultimate goal (goal). The one which (the devotees) do not return back (to the world) after attaining it, is my supreme abode."
"8.22 That highest Purusha, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Him alone within Whom all beings dwell and by Whom all this is pervaded.","8.22. Hey Parth! The Supreme Being, under whom all the beings are included and through whom this entire world is pervaded, is attainable only through exclusive devotion."
"8.23 Now I will tell thee, O chief of Bharatas, the times departing at which the Yogis will return or not return.",..8.23.. O Bharatashrestha! I will tell you the period (path) during which the yogis who have left their bodies attain non-repetition and (or) re-occurrence.
"8.24 Fire, light daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern path of the sun (the northern solstice)  departing then (by these) men who know Brahman go to Brahman.","..8.24.. Those Brahmavid devotees who go through the path of six months of Agni, Jyoti, Din, Shuklapaksha and Uttarayan after death, attain Brahma."
"8.25 Attaining to the lunar light by smoke, night time, the dark fortnight also, the six months of the southern path of the sun (the southern solstice), the Yogi returns.","..8.25.. The Yogi returns (to the world) after attaining the light of the moon through the six-monthly path of Dhoom, Night, Krishna Paksha and Dakshinayan."
8.26 The bright and the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal; by the one (the bright path) a man goes not to return and by the other (the dark path) he returns.,"8.26. These two types of Shukla and Krishna paths of the world are considered eternal. Of these, through one (Shukla) (the seeker) one achieves non-repetition and through the other (Krishna) one achieves repetition."
"8.27 Knowing these paths, O Arjuna, no Yogi is deluded; therefore at all times be steadfast in Yoga.","..8.27.. O Partha, no yogi who knows these two paths (from the elements) becomes bewildered. Therefore, O Arjuna! May you all become yogyukt in time."
"8.28 Whatever fruit of merit is declared (in the scriptures) to accrue from (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) sacrifices, (the practice of) austerities, and gifts  beyond all this goes the Yogi, having known this; and he attains to the Supreme Primeval (first or ancient) Abode.","..8.28.. Knowing all this (the essence of both the paths), a yogi person violates all the virtuous results mentioned in the study of Vedas, yagya, penance and charity and attains the original (eternal), supreme place."
"9.1 The Blessed Lord said  I shall now declare to thee who does not cavil, the greatest secret, the knowledge combined with experience (Self-realisation). Having known this thou shalt be free evil.","9.1. Shri Bhagwan said - For you Anasuyu (without flawed vision), I will tell you this secret knowledge along with science, knowing which you will be free from inauspicious (worldly bondage)."
"9.2 This is the kingl science, the kingly secret, the supreme purifier, realisable by direct intuitional knowledge, according to righteousness, very easy to perform and imperishable.","9.2. This knowledge is Rajvidya (king of knowledge) and Rajguhya (king of all secrets i.e. secrets) and is sacred, good, having direct knowledge and religious, and is easy and indispensable in doing."
"9.3 Those who have no faith in this Dharma (knowledge of the Self), O Parantapa (Arjuna), return to the path of this world of death without attaining Me.","9.3. Hey Parantap! In this religion, people without faith do not attain me but live (travel) in the world of death."
"9.4 All this world is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest aspect; all beings exist in Me, but I do not dwell in them.","9.4. This entire universe is pervaded by the unmanifested form of Me (God); The ghosts are present in me, but I am not present in them."
"9.5 Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality); behold My divine Yoga, supporting all beings, but not dwelling in them, is My Self, the efficient cause of beings.",9.5. And (in reality) the mere existence is not situated in me; Look at my divine yoga that my soul which holds the ghosts and which creates the ghosts is not present in those ghosts.
"9.6 As the mighty wind, moving everywhere, rests always in the ether, even so, know thou that all beings rest in Me.","9.6. Just as the great wind that travels everywhere is always present in the sky, similarly all the ghosts are present in me, know this."
"9.7 All beings, O Arjuna, go into My Nature at the end of a Kalpa; I send them forth again at the beginning of (the next) Kalpa.","9.7. Hey Konteya! (1) At the end of the Kalpa, all the ghosts attain my nature; And I create them again at the beginning of the (second) Kalpa."
"9.8 Animating My Nature, I again and again send forth all this multitude of beings, helpless by the force of the Nature.","9.8. By bringing nature under my control (i.e. by giving it consciousness), I again and again create this entire ghost community which has become dependent under the influence of nature."
"9.9 These acts do not bind Me, O Arjuna, sitting like one indifferent, unattached to those acts.","..9.9.. Hey Dhananjay! Those actions do not bind me (God), who is free from attachment and indifferent to those actions."
"9.10 Under Me as supervisor, Nature produces the moving and the unmoving; because of this, O Arjuna, the world revolves.",..9.10.. Hey Konteya! Because of me as the president (i.e. under my leadership) nature gives birth to the living world; This is why this world keeps rotating.
"9.11 Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great Lord of (all) beings.","9.11. Not knowing the ultimate meaning of Me, the great God of all beings, foolish people disrespect Me, the Supreme Soul, in human form."
"9.12 Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge and senseless, they verily are possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings.","9.12. Ignorant people with useless hopes, useless actions and useless knowledge retain the bewitching nature of demons and demons."
"9.13 But the great souls, O Arjuna, partaking of My divine nature, worship Me with a single mind (with the mind devoted to nothing else), knowing Me as the imperishable source of beings.","..9.13.. Hey Parth! But great men dependent on the divine nature, considering me to be the original cause and eternal form of all existences, worship me with a single mind."
"9.14 Always glorifying Me, striving,firm in vows, prostrating themselves before Me, they worship Me with devotion always steadfast.","..9.14.. Constantly chanting My Kirtan, hard-working, steadfast men, saluting Me, worshiping Me with daily devotion."
"9.15 Others also sacrificing with the wisdom-sacrifice worship Me, the All-faced, as one, as distinct, and as manifold.","9.15. Some worship me with a sense of unity while worshiping me through the Gyan Yagya, some worship me with a separate feeling, some worship me as a vast form (Vishwato Mukham) in many ways."
9.16 I am the Kratu; I am the Yajna; I am the offering (food) to the manes; I am the medicinal herbs and all the plants; I am the Mantra; I am also the Ghee or the melted butter; I am the fire; I am the oblation.,"..9.16.. I am Rikratu; I am Yagya; I am Swadha and medicine, I am Mantra, I am Ghee, I am Fire and I am Hutan i.e. Havan Karma."
"9.17 I am the father of this world, the mother, the dispenser of the fruits of actions and the 
grandfather; the (one) thing to be known, the purifier, the sacred monosyllable (Om), and also the Rik-, the Sama-and the Yajur-Vedas.","9.17. I am the father, mother, dhata (bearer) and grandfather of this world, I am the Vedya (thing worth knowing), I am the sacred, Omkar, Rigveda, Samveda and Yajurveda."
"9.18 I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the shelter, the friend, the origin, the dissolution, the foundation, the treasure-house and the seed which is imperishable.","..9.18.. I am the speed (goal), the sustainer, the Lord (master), the witness, the abode, the refuge and friend and also the origin, the form of destruction and the place (base), the foundation and the eternal cause."
"9.19 (As the sun) I give heat; I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also death, existence and non-existence, O Arjuna.",..9.19.. Hey Arjun! I alone (in the form of the Sun) get hot; I control and emit rain. I am nectar and death and true and false.
"9.20 The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, purified of all sins, worshipping Me by sacrifices, pray for the way to heaven; they reach the holy world of the Lord of the gods and enjoy in heavn the divine pleasures of the gods.","..9.20.. Those who know the three Vedas (those who perform fruitful actions based on Vedas), those who drink soma and those who are purified from sins, want to attain heaven by worshiping me through yagyas; Those men attain Indraloka as a result of their good deeds and enjoy the pleasures of the divine gods in heaven."
"9.21 They, having enjoyed the vast heaven, enter the world of mortals when their merit is exhausted; thus abiding by the injunctions of the ï1threeï1 (Vedas) and desiring (objects of) desires, they attain to the state of going and returning.","..9.21.. After enjoying that vast heaven, when their virtues wane, they reach the world of death. In this way, the people who take refuge in the work as stated in the three Vedas and desire the pleasures, attain the state of transportation (Gatagata)."
"9.22 For those men who worship Me alone, thinking of no other, for those ever-united, I secure what is not already possessed and preserve what they already possess.",..9.22.. I take care of the welfare of those devotees who worship me by thinking of me with utmost devotion.
"9.23 Even those devotees who, endowed with faith, worship other gods, worship Me alone, O Arjuna, b the wrong method.","..9.23.. Hey Konteya! The devotees with faith who worship other gods, also worship me unrighteously."
"9.24 (For) I alone am the enjoyer and also the Lord of all sacrifices; but they do not know Me in essence (in reality), and hence they fall (return to this mortal world).","..9.24.. Because I am the enjoyer and master of all yagyas, but they do not know Me in essence, that is why they fall, that is, they attain the world."
9.25 The worshippers of the gods go to them; to the manes go the ancestor-worshippers; to the deities who preside over the elements go their worshippers; but My devotees come to Me.,"..9.25.. The worshipers of the Gods go to the Gods, the worshipers of the ancestors go to the ancestors, the worshipers of the ghosts go to the ghosts and the devotees who worship me go to me only."
"9.26 Whoever offers Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a little water  that, so offered devotedly by the pure-minded, I accept.","..9.26.. Any devotee who offers leaves, flowers, fruits, water etc. for me with devotion, I enjoy that devotionally offered (Patra Pushpadi) of that pure minded devotee, that is, I accept it."
"9.27 Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest in sacrifice, whatever thou givest, whatever thou practisest as austerity, O Arjuna, do it as an offering unto Me.","..9.27.. Hey Konteya! Whatever work you do, whatever you eat, whatever havan you perform, whatever you donate and whatever penance you perform, you should offer it all to me."
"9.28 Thus shalt thou be freed from the bonds of actions yielding good and evil fruits; with the mind steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and liberated, thou shalt come unto Me.","..9.28.. In this way you will be freed from the bondages of karma as a result of good and bad luck; And if you become wise through Sannyasa Yoga, you will become free and reach me."
9.29 The same am I to all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear; but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me and I am also in them.,..9.29.. I am equal to all beings; Neither is anyone unpleasant nor dear to me; But those who worship me with devotion are in me and I am also in them.
"9.30 Even if the most sinful worships Me, with devotion to none else, he too should indeed by regarded as righteous for he has rightly resolved.","..9.30.. If even a very evil person becomes my devotee and worships me with full dedication, he deserves to be considered a saint because he has true faith."
"9.31 Soon he becomes righteous and attains to eternal peace; O Arjuna, proclaim thou for certain that My devotee never perishes.","..9.31.. O Kaunteya, he soon becomes a virtuous soul and attains eternal peace. You must know the truth that my devotee never gets destroyed."
"9.32 For, taking refuge in Me, they also who, O Arjuna, may be of a sinful birth  women, Vaisyas as well as Sudras  attain the Supreme Goal.","..9.32.. Hey Parth! Women, Vaishyas and Shudras, whosoever are sinful, they also attain the supreme state by depending on me (surrendering to me)."
"9.33 How much more (easily) then the hold Brahmins and devoted royal saints (attain the goal); having come to this impermanent and unhappy world, do thou worship Me.","..9.33.. Then what is there to say that virtuous Brahmins and Rajarshi devotees (achieve the supreme state); (Therefore) after attaining this impermanent and pleasureless world, (now) you worship me with devotion."
"9.34 Fix thy mind on Me; by devoted to Me; sacrifice unto Me; bow down to Me; having thus united thy whole self to Me, taking Me as the supreme goal, thou shalt come unto Me.","..9.34.. (You) be of steadfast mind in Me; Become my devotee and my worshipper; Greet me; In this way, by becoming self-oriented (i.e., whose ultimate goal is I), by uniting your soul with me, you will attain me."
"10.1 The Blessed Lord said  Again, O mighty-armed Arjuna, listen to my supreme word which I will declare to thee who who art beloved, for thy welfare.","10.1. Shri Bhagwan said – O mighty-armed one! Again, listen to my supreme words, which I will say with a desire to benefit the one who loves you very much."
10.2 Neither the hosts of the gods nor the great sages know My origin; for in every way I am the source of all the gods and the great sages.,10.2. Neither the gods nor the great sages know my origin (Prabhav); Because I am the original cause of all the gods and Maharishis also.
"10.3 He who knows Me as unborn and beginningless, as the great Lord of the worlds, he, among mortals, is undeluded and he is liberated from all sins.","10.3. One who knows Me as the unborn, the eternal and the great Lord of the worlds, such a person free from attachment (knowledgeable) among mortal beings becomes free from all sins."

Wisdom, knowledge, absence of attachment, forgiveness, truth, dam (sense control), sham (mind control), happiness, sorrow, birth and death, fear and fearlessness."
"10.5 Non-injury, eanimity, contentment, austerity, beneficence, fame, ill-fame  (these) different kinds of alities of beings arise from Me alone.","10.5. Non-violence, equality, contentment, penance, charity. The various feelings of such creatures as fame and infamy are manifested from me only."
"10.6 The seven great sages, the ancient four and also the Manus, possessed of powers like Me (on account of their minds being fixed on Me), were born of (My) mind; from them are these creatures born in this world.","10.6. The seven Maharishis, the four (Sankadis) of the past and the (fourteen) Manus, these have arisen from my resolution under my influence, whose subjects are in this world (world)."
10.7 He who in truth knows these manifold manifestations of My Being and (this) Yoga-power of Mine becomes established in the unshakable Yoga; there is no doubt about it.,"..10.7.. The man who knows this My Vibhuti and Yoga from the essence, he becomes equipped with Avikampa Yoga (i.e. motionless meditation yoga), there is no doubt in this."
"10.8 I am the source of all; from Me everything evolves; understanding thus, the wise, endowed with meditation, worship Me.","10.8. I am the dominant place of all; It is only from me that the whole world attains development, knowing this the wise people worship me with full devotion."
"10.9 With their mind and their life wholly absorbed in Me, enlightening each other and ever speaking of Me, they are satisfied and delighted.","10.9. The devotees who fix their mind on Me and surrender their lives (senses) to Me, always become satisfied and happy while making each other aware of Me and talking about Me."
"10.10 To them who are ever steadfast, worshipping Me with love, I give the Yoga of discrimination by which they come to Me.","..10.10.. To those devotees who are daily united with me and worship me with love, I give the 'Buddhiyoga' by which they attain me."
"10.11 Out of mere compassion for them, I, dwelling within their Self, destroy the darkness born of ignorance by the luminous lamp of knowledge.","..10.11.. To show favor to them, I reside in their hearts and destroy the darkness born of ignorance with the lamp of luminous knowledge."
"10.12 Arjuna said  Thou art the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode (or the supreme light), the supreme purifier, eternal, divine Person, the primeval God, unborn andn omnipresent.","..10.12.. Arjun said - You are the ultimate Brahma, the ultimate abode and the ultimate pure; The eternal divine man, the progenitor of gods, is birthless and omnipresent."
"10.13 All the sages have thus declared Thee, as also the divine sage Narada; so also Asita, Devala and Vyasa; and now Thou Thyself sayest so to me.","10.13. This is what all the sages say to you;  Similarly, Devarshi Narad, Asit, Deval Rishi and Vyas and you yourself also say about me."
"10.14 I believe all this that Thou sayest to me to be true, O Krishna; verily, O blessed Lord! neither the gods nor the demons know Thy manifestation (origin).","..10.14.. Hey Keshav! Whatever you say about me, I consider it all to be true. Oh Lord, neither the gods nor the demons know your (real) form."

In spiritual knowledge, eternity i.e. stability and the philosophy of God as the meaning of philosophy, all this is called knowledge, and whatever is contrary to this is ignorance."
"13.13 I will declare that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to immortality, the beginningless supreme Brahman, called neither being nor non-being.","..13.13.. I will clearly describe that knowable object by knowing which man attains immortality. He is knowable - the eternal, ultimate Brahma, who can be called neither true nor false."

"13.15 Shining by the functions of all the senses, yet without the senses; unattached, yet supporting all; devoid of alities, yet their experiencer.","..13.15.. He is illuminated by the qualities (functions) of all the senses, but is (actually) devoid of all the senses; Despite being free from attachment and devoid of virtues, He is the sustainer of all and the enjoyer of virtues."
"13.16 Without and within (all) beings the unmoving and also the moving; because of Its subtlety, unknowable; and near and far away is That.",..13.16.. (That Brahma) is situated within the existence of mere existence; He is variable and also constant. Being subtle it is undetectable; He is both distant and very close.

"13.21 In the production of the effect and the cause, Nature (matter) is said to be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the cause.",..13.21.. Prakriti is said to be the cause in giving rise to cause and effect and Purusha is said to be the cause in the enjoyment of happiness and sorrow.
13.22 The soul seated in Nature experiences the alities born of Nature; attachment to the alities is the cause of its birth in good and evil wombs.,..13.22.. A man situated in nature enjoys the qualities emanating from nature. The combination of these qualities is the reason for this man (being) to be born in auspicious and inauspicious species.

"13.27 Wherever a being is born, whether unmoving or moving, know thou, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), that it is from the union between the field and its knower.","..13.27.. O great Bharat! In other words, whatever immovable or movable object is produced, you should know that it has arisen from the combination of the field and the knower of the field."
"13.28 He sees, who sees the Supreme Lord, existing eally in all beings, the unperishing within the perishing.","..13.28.. The man who sees the immortal God present in all mortal beings with equanimity, only he (really) sees."
13.29 Because he who sees the same Lord eally dwelling everywhere does not destroy the Self by the self; he goes to the highest goal.,"..13.29..

When this man sees the separate expressions of the ghosts situated in one (God) and knows that this expansion has come from Him (God) only, then he attains Brahma."
"13.32 Being without beginning and being devoid of (any) alities, the Supreme Self, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted.","..13.32.. Hey Konteya! Being eternal and without qualities, this God is indestructible. Although situated in the body, in reality, he neither performs (actions) nor gets attached (to the fruits)."
"13.33 As the all-pervading ether is not tainted, because of its subtlety, so the Self seated everywhere in the body is not tainted.","..13.33.. Just as the omnipresent sky does not get entangled because it is subtle, in the same way the soul present in the body does not get entangled everywhere."
"13.34 Just as the one sun illumines the whole world, so also the Lord of the field (Supreme Self) 
illumines the whole field, O Arjuna.","..13.34.. Hey India! Just as only one sun illuminates the entire world, in the same way only one Kshetri (expert in the field) illuminates the entire region."
"13.35 They who, by the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the field and its knower and also the liberation from the Nature of being, go to the Supreme.","..13.35.. Thus, those men who, through the eye of knowledge, know the difference between the field and the knower of the field and salvation from the disorders of nature, they attain the Supreme Brahma."

Shri Bhagwan said - I will again tell you about the supreme knowledge, which is the best among all the knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the ultimate success after leaving this world."
"14.2 They who, having taken refuge in this knowledge, have attained to unity with Me, are neither born at the time of creation nor are they disturbed at the time of dissolution.","14.2. By taking refuge in this knowledge, the people who attain my form (Sardhamyam) do not take birth in the beginning of creation and do not get troubled in the time of destruction."
"14.3 My womb is the great Brahma; in that I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings.",14.3. Hey India! My Mahad Brahmarup Prakriti is the vagina (of the ghosts) in which I conceive; From this all ghosts are born.
"14.4 Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb and I am the seed-giving father.","..14.4.. Hey Konteya! All the idols (bodies) that are born in all the births, the birth i.e. the womb of all of them is Mahadbrahma and I am the father who establishes the seed."
"14.5 Purity, passion and inertia  these alities, O Arjuna, born of Nature, bind fast in the body, the embodied, the indestructible.","..14.5.. Oh great arms! Sattva, Raja and Tama, these three qualities arising from nature bind the physical soul with the body."
"14.6 Of these, Sattva, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by attachment to happiness and by attachment to knowledge, O sinless one.","..14.6.. O sinless Arjun! Of these (three), Sattva Guna, being pure, is luminous and anamaya (free from matter, free from disorders); (He binds the living being) with attachment to happiness and attachment to knowledge."
"14.7 Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual enjoyment) and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action.","14.7. Hey Konteya! Know Rajoguna as the form of Raga, which gives rise to craving and attachment. He binds the physical soul with the attachment of deeds."
"14.8 But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it binds fast, O Arjuna, by heedlessness, indolence and sleep.","..14.8.. And oh India! Know that Tamoguna arises from ignorance; Which fascinates all the living beings. He binds the living being through carelessness, laziness and sleep."
"14.9 Sattva attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while Tamas verily shrouding knowledge attaches to heedlessness.","..14.9.. Hey India! Sattva guna makes one engrossed in happiness and Rajo guna in action, but Tamo guna covers the knowledge and makes the living being in a state of heedlessness."
"14.10 Now Sattva arises (prevails), O Arjuna, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; nor Rajas, having overpowered Sattva and Tamas; and now Tamas, having overpowered Sattva and Rajas.","..14.10.. Hey India! Sometimes Sattva Guna increases by suppressing Rajas and Tama, sometimes Tama Guna increases by suppressing Rajas and Satva, and sometimes Rajo Guna increases by suppressing Tama and Satva."
"14.11 When through every gate (sense) in this body, the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattva is predominant.","..14.11.. When light in the form of knowledge arises in the doors of this body i.e. in all the senses, then know that Sattva Guna has increased."
"14.12 Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing  these arise when Rajas is predominant, O Arjuna.","..14.12.. O great Bharata! When Rajogun increases, greed, tendency (common intention), initiation of actions, lack of shame and desire, all these arise."
"14.13 Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusion  these arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna.","..14.13.. Hey Kurunandan! When Tamoguna increases, darkness, indifference, carelessness and attachment all arise."
"14.14 If the embodied one meets with death when Sattva is predominant, then he attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.","..14.14.. When this living being (Dehbhrit) dies in the growth of Sattva Guna, then those who do good deeds attain the pure worlds i.e. heaven."
"14.15 Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless.","..14.15.. After dying during the progression of Rajoguna, he takes birth in the human world and during the progression of Tamoguna (after death), he takes birth in the world of foolishness."
"14.16 The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattvic and pure, verily the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas.",..14.16.. The results of good deeds have been said to be pure and pure; The result of Rajogun is sorrow and the result of Tamogun is ignorance.
"14.17 From Sattva arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness and delusion arise from Tamas, and also ignorance.","..14.17.. Knowledge arises from Sattva Guna. Rajogun gives rise to greed and Tamagogun gives rise to carelessness, attachment and ignorance."
"14.18 Those who are seated in Sattva go upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards.",..14.18.. Men situated in Sattva Guna go higher (to the worlds); Rajasic people live in the middle (human world) and Tamasic people living in extremely inferior tendencies of Tamogun attain degradation.

This physical man, having gone beyond the three gunas due to the origin of the body, attains immortality and is freed from birth, death, aging and sorrows."

What characteristics does a man who has gone beyond these three qualities possess? What kind of behavior does he have? And, by what means does he go beyond these three qualities?"
"14.22 The Blessed Lord said  When light, activity and delusion are present, he hates them not, nor does he long for them when they are absent.","..14.22.. Shri Bhagwan said – O Pandava! (The wise man) does not hate light, inclination and attachment even when he is affected by them and does not yearn for them when he retires."
"14.23 He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the alities, and who, knowing that the alities are active, is self-centred and moves not.",..14.23.. One who remains seated like an indifferent person cannot be disturbed by the qualities and remains stable knowing that “the qualities only behave” and does not get distracted from that position.
"14.24 Who is the same in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, stone and gold are alike, who is the same to the dear and the unfriendly, who is firm, and to whom censure and praise are as one.","..14.24.. One who is healthy (situated in form), remains equal in happiness and sorrow and has equanimity among soil, stone and gold; Such a brave man considers what is liked and what is unpleasant and criticism and self-praise as equal."
"14.25 Who is the same in honour and dishonour, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakings  he is said to have transcended the alities.","..14.25.. Who is equal in honor and dishonor; There is equality in favor of enemy and friend, such a man who forsakes everything from the beginning is said to be Gunateet."

Shri Bhagwan said - (The wise man calls this worldly tree) Ashvattha and Avya having vertical root and half branch; The one who knows such (worldly tree) whose leaves are verses i.e. Vedas, is a Vedavit."

Hey Hrishikesh! Hey Keshanishudan! I want to know the elements of renunciation and renunciation separately.
18.2 The Blessed Lord said  The sages understand Sannyasa to be the renunciation of action with desire; the wise declare the abandonment of the fruits of all actions as Tyaga.,18.2. Sri Bhagavan said - (Some) poets (pundits) consider renunciation of lustful deeds as 'Sanyas' and thoughtful people call renunciation of the fruits of all deeds as 'Tyaga'.

Some sages say that all actions are worth relinquishing because they are flawed; And others say that yagya, charity and penance are not shunable."

Hey Bharatsattam! You listen to my decision regarding that sacrifice. O great man! That sacrifice has been said to be of three types.
"18.5 Acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed; sacrifice, gift and also austerity are the purifiers of the wise.","..18.5.. Yagya, charity and penance are not something to be forsaken, but they are undoubtedly a duty; Yagya, charity and penance purify the mystics."
"18.6 But even these actions should be performed leaving aside attachment and the desire for rewards, O Arjuna; this is My certain and best conviction.","..18.6.. Hey Parth! These actions should also be performed by abandoning the fruits and attachments, this is my firm opinion."
18.7 Verily the renunciation of obligatory action is not proper; the abandonment of the same from delusion is declared to be Tamasic.,..18.7.. It is not right to abandon one's duty; Renunciation of attachment due to attachment is called “Tamas renunciation”.
"18.8 He who abandons action on account of the fear of bodily trouble (because it is painful), does not obtain the merit of renunciation by doing such Rajasic renunciation.","..18.8.. The person who considers his work as a sorrow and renounces it due to the fear of physical pain, that man never attains the fruit of renunciation by making that rajasic renunciation."
"18.9 Whatever obligatory action is done, O Arjuna, merely because it ought to be done, abandoning attachment and also the desire for reward, that renunciation is regarded as Sattvic (pure).","..18.9.. Hey Arjun! The duty which is performed with the understanding that it is a duty to do it, renouncing attachment and results, is considered as sattvik renunciation."
"18.10 The man of renunciation, pervaded by purity, intelligent, and with his doubts cut asunder, does not hate a disagreeable work nor is he attached to an agreeable one.","..18.10.. The man who does not hate unskilled (inauspicious) deeds and is not attached to skilled (auspicious) deeds, that man who is full of Sattva Guna, is free from doubt, intelligent (knowledgeable) and a renouncer."
"18.11 Verily, it is not possible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely; but he who relinishes the rewards of actions is verily called a man of renunciation.","..18.11.. Because it is not possible for a human being to give up the remaining karmas, the one who has renounced the fruits of his actions is called a renunciationist."
"18.12 The threefold fruit of action (evil, good and mixed) accrues after death to the non-abandoners, but never to the abandoners.","..18.12.. These threefold fruits of auspicious, inauspicious and mixed deeds are received only by the renunciant people even after death; But never to sannyasi men."
"18.13 Learn from Me, O mighty-armed Arjuna, these five causes as declared in the Sankhya system for the accomplishment of all actions.","..18.13.. Oh great arms! These five reasons for the accomplishment of all actions have been stated in the Sankhya principle, which you should know very well from me."
"18.14 The seat (body), the doer, the various senses, the different functions of various sorts, and the presiding deity, also, the fifth.","..18.14.. Adhishthana (body), subject, various causes (senses etc.), various and different movements and the fifth reason is God."

Now in this situation, the person who, due to his uncultured intellect, considers only the pure soul as the doer, does not see the evil person (the reality)."
"18.17 He who is free from the egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted (by good or evil), 
though he slays these people, he slayeth not, nor is he bound (by the action).","..18.17.. The man who does not have the feeling of ego and whose intellect is not attached to any (good or bad) thing, even after killing all these worlds, that man neither actually dies nor gets bound (by sin)."

Knowledge, knowable and knower, these three ways are the drivers of action, and, Karan, Karma. The subject is a collection of threefold action."
"18.19 Knowledge, action and actor are declared in the science of the Gunas (Sankhya philosophy) to be of three kinds only, according to the distinction of the Gunas. Of these also, hear duly.","..18.19.. Knowledge, action and doer are also called triple in Sankhyashastra (Gunasankhyanae) due to the difference of qualities; You should listen to them as per the correct form from me."
"18.20 That by which one sees the one indestructible Reality in all beings, not separate in all the separate beings  know thou that knowledge to be Sattvic.","..18.20.. The knowledge by which man sees the one undivided and imperishable (Avyaya) form in all the entities existing in divided form, you should consider that knowledge as Sattvik."
18.21 But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct kinds as different from one another  know thou that knowledge to be Rajasic.,"..18.21.. The knowledge through which a man knows different aspects of all the beings, you should consider that knowledge as Rajas."
"18.22 But that which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without reason, without foundation in Truth, and trivial  that is declared to be Tamasic.","..18.22.. And the knowledge through which a person becomes attached to a work (body) as if that (work itself) is the complete thing and which (knowledge) is without reason (irrational), devoid of meaning and narrow (limited), that (knowledge) ) is tamas."
"18.23 An action which is ordained, which is free from attachment, and which is done without love or hatred by one who is not desirous of any reward  that action is declared to be Sattvic.","..18.23.. The action which is determined (according to the scriptures) and has no accompaniment, and is done without any attachment or aversion by a person who does not want the result, that (action) is called Sattvik."

The doer who is free from attachments, free from egoism, full of patience and enthusiasm and remains unperturbed in the accomplishment (success) and asiddhi (failure) of the work, is called Sattvik."

The doer who is passionate, desirous of the fruits of action, greedy, violent in nature, impure and filled with joy and sorrow is called Rajas."

"18.29 Hear thou the threefold division of intellect and firmness according to the Gunas, as I declare them fully and distinctly, O Arjuna.","..18.29.. Hey Dhananjay! Listen to the threefold difference between intelligence and wisdom arising from the gunas, spoken about by me in essence and separately."
"18.30 The intellect which knows the path of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation  that intellect is Sattvic (pure), O Arjuna.","..18.30.. Hey Parth! The intellect which knows the principle of tendency and withdrawal, action and non-action, fear and fearlessness, bondage and salvation, is that intellect which is Satvik."
"18.31 That, by which one wrongly understands Dharma and Adharma and also what ought to be done and what ought not to be done  that intellect, O Arjuna, is Rajasic (passionate).","..18.31.. Hey Parth! The intellect by which a man does not know righteousness and unrighteousness and what is duty and what is not, is a royal intellect."
"18.32 That, which, enveloped in darkness, sees Adharma as Dharma and all things perverted  that intellect, O Arjuna, is Tamasic (dark).","..18.32.. Hey Parth! The intellect which is covered with Tamas (darkness of ignorance) and considers unrighteousness as religion and knows all things in opposite ways, that intellect is Tamasic."
"18.33 The unwavering firmness by which, through Yoga, the functions of the mind, the life-force and the senses are restrained  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Sattvic (pure).",..18.33.. It is sattvikhi.
"18.34 But that, O Arjuna, by which, on account of attachment and desire for reward, one holds fast to Dharma (duty), enjoyment of pleasures and earning of wealth  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Rajasic (passionate).","..18.34.. Oh Arjun, son of Pritha! The Dhriti by which a man desirous of achieving the results of his actions, with extreme attachment (context), adheres to Dharma, Artha and Kama (these three purushaarthas), that Dhriti is royal."
"18.35 That, by which a stupid man does not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair and also conceit  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Tamasic.","..18.35.. Yes Parth! The Dharti by which an unintelligent person does not give up dreams, fear, grief, sadness and intoxication is Tamasic."
