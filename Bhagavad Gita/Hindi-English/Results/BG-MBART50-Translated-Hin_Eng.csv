"1.1 Dhritarashtra said  What did my people and the sons of Pandu do when they had assembled
together eager for battle on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya.","Dhritarashtra said, “Hey Sanjay, what did my sons and Pandu, who wanted to fight in Dharma Bhoomi Kurukshetra, do? ”"
"1.2. Sanjaya said  Having seen the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle-array,
King Duryodhana then approached his teacher (Drona) and spoke these words.","Sanjay said: When King Duryodhana saw the vision of the Pandava Army, he went to Acharya Drona and said these words."
"1.3. ""Behold, O Teacher! this mighty army of the sons of Pandu,
arrayed by the son of Drupada, thy wise disciple.",Look at this great army of Pandu sons formed by your wise disciple Drupadputra - LRB - Dashpaddum - RRB -.

and Arjuna, Yoyudhana (Satyaki), Virata and Drupada, of the great car (mighty
warriors).","In this army there are great archers armed with bow, who are like Bhima and Arjuna in battle, such as Yuudhana, Visva and Maharthi Raja Drupada."

who are the most distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army;
these I name to thee for thy information.","You, Bijottam, know the distinguished warriors who are also on our side; I will give you the names of the heroes of my army for your information."
"1.8. ""Thyself and Bhishma, and Karna and also Kripa, the victorious

lives for my sake, armed with various weapons and missiles, all well-skilled

"1.10. ""This army of ours marshalled by Bhishma is insufficient,
whereas that army of theirs marshelled by Bhima is sufficient.","Our army protected by Bhishma is inadequate; but his army protected by Bhima is sufficient, or our army protected by Bhishma is finite but his army protected by Bhima is finite."
"1.11. ""Therefore do ye all, stationed in your respective positions,
in the several divisions of the army, protect Bhishma alone.""","All of you, standing in your own place on different platforms, protect Him from all sides."
"1.12. His glorious grandsire (Bhishma), the oldest of the Kauravas,
in order to cheer Duryodhana, now roared like a lion, and blew his conch.","At that time, the elderly prince Bhishma, the great father of the Kauravas, cried out in a loud voice, bringing joy to his heart."
"1.13. Then (following Bhishma), conches and kettledrums, tabors,
drums and cow horns blared forth ite suddenly (from the Kaurava side)
and the sound was tremendous.","Subsequently, the instruments of Shankha, Nagare, ढोal and Sringi, etc., were played simultaneously and the words of which were utterly terrible."
"1.14. Then, also, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna),
seated in the magnificent chariot, yoked with white horses, blew divine
conches.","After this, Madhava (Shri Krishna) and Panduputra Arjun, sitting in a magnificent chariot with white horses, also played their divine arrows."

"1.17. The king of Kasi, an exellent archer, Sikhandi, the mighty
car-warrior, Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unconered.","The sixth archer Kashiraj, Maharthi Shikhandi, Dhrashdyumna, Raja Virat and Anyaya Satyaki."
"1.18. Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the earth, and
the son of Subhadra, the mighty-armed, blew their conches separately.","Raja Durupad, the son of Draupadi and Mahabahu Saubhadra (Abhimanu) all played different rhythms."
"1.19. That tumultuous sound rent the hearts of (the members of)
Dhritarashtra's party, making both the heaven and the earth resound.","He began to whistle on the heavens and the earth, and he distorted the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra."
"1.20. Then, seeing the people of Dhritarashtra’s party standing
arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of
Pandu, whose ensign was a monkey, took up his bow and said the following
to Krishna, O Lord of the earth.","Thus, when the war was about to begin, Captain Arjun, looking at the position of the sons of Dhritarashtra, lifted his bow and said these words to Lord Krishna."
"1.21 Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.","Arjun said, Hey, Achyut, raise my chariot between the two armies."
"1.22. Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.",From which I can observe those who stand with the will to fight who I have to fight in this war.
"1.23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight,
wishing to please in battle the evil-minded Duryodhana (the son of Dhritarashtra).","I will see the warriors who are gathered here, the lovers of the war of the wise and righteous nation."
"1.24. Sanjaya said  Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna, having stationed that
best of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies.","Sanjay said, ""O India (Dritrashtra)! Lord Krishna raised the best chariot between the two armies after Arjuna had said this."
"1.25. In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the
earth, said: ""O Arjuna (son of Pritha), behold these Kurus gathered together.""","In the presence of Bhishma, Drona and all the rulers of the earth, he said, ""Look at the crows gathered here, Pathr."""
"1.26. Then, Arjuna (son of Pritha) saw there (in the armies) stationed,
fathers and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons
and friends too.","There Arjun also saw the brothers of his father, the father - in - law, the teachers, the mothers, the brothers, the sons, the father - in - law, the friends, the father - in - law and the brother - in - law standing in the two armies."
"1.27. (He saw) fathers-in-law and friends also in both the armies.
The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those kinsmen thus standing arrayed,
spoke this, sorrowfully filled with deep pity.","Thus seeing all the brothers and sisters standing, Arjuna, the son of Kunti, was filled with compassion and said this sadly."
"1.28. Arjuna said  Seeing these, my kinsmen, O krishna, arrayed, eager to fight.","Arjun said, ""O Krishna, when I see these people willing to fight, my limbs are weakened, my mouth is drying and my body is shaking and trembling."
"1.29. My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body ivers and
my hair stands on end.","Arjun said, 'O Krishna, when I see these people who are willing to fight, my limbs are weakened, my mouth is dry and my body is shaken and shaken."
"1.30. The (bow) Gandiva slips from my hand, and also my skins burns
all over; I am unable even to stand and my mind is reeling, as it were.",1. 30. The candle is falling from my hand and the skin is burning. My mind is confused and I am unable to stand.
"1.31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava. I do not see any good
in killing my kinsmen in battle.","I see the opposite, Keshav, and I see no good by killing my own people in war."
"1.32. I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.
Of what avail is dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?","I do not seek victory, nor do I seek the kingdom, nor do I seek happiness. Govinda, what is our purpose in the kingdom, or in the enjoyment, or in the life?"
"1.33. Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,
stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.","It is those of us who seek the kingdom, enjoyment and comfort who are at war, abandoning the hope of wealth and life."
"1.34. Teachers, fathers, sons and also grandfathers, maternal uncles,
fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives,-","They are Gurujan, Tao, uncle, son, father - in - law, Vishnu, grandson, Shylak and other relatives."
"1.35. These I do not wish to kill, though they kill me, O Krishna,
even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds; leave alone killing
them for the sake of the earth.","Honey, I do not want to kill them for their killing me or for the kingdom of the heavens, then what do I say to the earth?"
"1.36. By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can
be ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue to us from killing these felons.",Why should we be happy to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra? It would be a sin for us to kill these terrorists.
"1.37. Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra,
our relatives; for how can we be happy by killing our own people, O Madhava
(Krishna)?","Therefore, Madhava, it is not worthy of us to kill the sons of our ancestor Dhritarashtra, for how happy we will be by killing our own people."
"1.38. Though they, with intelligence overpowered by greed, see
no evil in the destruction of families, and no sin in hostility to friends,","However, corrupted by greed, these people do not see sin in the ruined guilt and the betrayal of friends."
"1.39. Why should not we who clearly see evil in the destruction
of families, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana (Krishna)?","But, O mankind, why should we not think, those of us who know the sin of total decay, that we should turn away from this sin?"
"1.40. In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious
rites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety,
indeed, overcomes the whole family.","1. 40. The destruction of the tribe destroys the eternal religion. When the religion is destroyed, the whole tribe is crushed by disbelief."
"1.41. By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of
the family become corrupt; and , women being corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant
of Vrishni), there arises intermingling of castes.","The increase in sin, O Krishna, leads to the poisoning of the women of the tribe, and the poisoning of the women leads to the formation of the carnage."
"1.42. Confusion of castes leads to hell the slayers of the family,
for their forefathers fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-ball and
water (libations).","It leads to the slaughter of the carnage - victims and the whole family. Their fathers, who are deprived of bodies and watering, also fall into hell."
"1.43. By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which
cause confusion of castes, the eternal religious rites of the caste and
the family are destroyed.",These characteristic defects destroy the eternal cult and the caste cult by the fatal defects.
"1.44. We have heard, O Janardana, that inevitable is the dwelling
for an unknown period in hell for those men in whose families the religious
practices have been destroyed.",We have heard that those whose whole religion is destroyed here will live in hell for an indefinite time.
"1.45. Alas! We are involved in a great sin, in that we are
prepared to kill our kinsmen, through greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.",It is a pity that we are determined to commit a great sin and are prepared to destroy our family out of the lust of this kingdom.
"1.46. If the sons of Dhritarashtra with weapons in hand should
slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.","If these armed men would kill my unarmed and unrepentant in the Kaurava War, it would be beneficial to me."
"1.47. Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna,
casting away his bow and arrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot with
his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.","Sanjay said: In the battlefield (number), Arjun, grieved, left the bow with the arrow and sat in the back of the chariot."
"2.1 Sanjaya said  To him who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, Madhusudana (the destroyer of Madhu) or Krishna spoke these words.","Sanjay said - Thus said Madhusudan to Akul Arjun, a man of compassion and despair, with his eyes full of bitterness."
"2.2 The Blessed Lord said  Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of you, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon you, O Arjuna?","2. 2. Sri Bhagwan said, “O Arjuna, where did this fascination arise for you in this unique place? It is neither a means of achieving heaven nor a source of glory, contrary to the Aryan practice. ”"
"2.3 Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha. It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean weakness of the heart! Stand up, O scorcher of the foes!","2. 3. Don 't be a parish poet. This is unfortunate for you, O Lord. Forsake the small weakness of your heart."
"2.4 Arjuna said  How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?","Arjun said, ""Holy Madhusudan, how shall I fight the arrows with Bhishma and the dragon in the battlefield?"
"2.5 Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires will be stained with (their) blood.","It is more beneficial in this world to receive the fruits of the cult by killing these great Gurus, for by killing the Gurus I will enjoy the bloody meanings and pleasures of the world."
"2.6 I can hardly tell which will be better, that we should  coner them or that they should coner us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us.","We do not know what is right for us to do. We do not know whether we will win, or whether they will win, those whom we do not want to kill to survive are the sons of Dhritarashtra who stand before us for war."
2.7 My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity; my mind is confused as to duty. I ask Thee: Tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who has taken refuge in Thee.,"Confused with the lust of compassion and confused by the path of duty, I ask you to determine what is creditable to me, for I am your disciple; teach me in refuge."
"2.8 I do not see that it would remove this sorrow that burns up my senses, even if I should attain prosperous and unrivalled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods.","2. 8 I do not see a remedy to remove this sorrow which comforts my senses, even though I have an eternal rich kingdom on earth and the ownership of the gods."
"2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the coneror of sleep), the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna, ""I will not fight"" and became silent.","2. 9. Sanjay said - Thus, Govinda said to Arjuna, the Lord, ""I will not fight."""
"2.10 To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Krishna, as if smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words.","2. 10. < s > Dear India (Dritrashtra)! Let this word be spoken to Arjuna, the sad man in the midst of the two armies, laughing."
"2.11 The Blessed Lord said  Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.","The Lord said: You mourn for those for whom it is not right to mourn, and you say words to the wise, but the wise men do not mourn for the dead and the living."
"2.12 Nor at any time indeed was I not, nor thou, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease to be hereafter.","It is not true that I was not in any time, or you were not, or these kings were not, and it is not true that we will not all live beyond this."
"2.13 Just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does it pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat.","As the deity in this body is the adolescent, young and old age of the living soul, so it receives the other body; the restless man is not enchanted by it."
"2.14 The contacts of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold, pleasure and pain, have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna.","2. 14. O Kuntiputra, the combination of the cold and the hot and the pleasant and the painful senses and subjects is the beginning and the end; they are untrue, therefore, O India, endure them."
"2.15 That firm man whom, surely, these afflict not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality.",He who lives with the same feeling of pain and happiness as the restless man cannot be disturbed by it is the servant of immortality.
2.16 The unreal hath no being; there is non-being of the real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the Truth (or the seers of the Essence).,"There is no existence of the inanimate and there is never a absence of the being. Thus, the same principle of both is seen by the principled wise men."
"2.17 Know that to be indestructible, by Which all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable.",Know that which is inexhaustible in the whole world. No one is able to destroy that which is inexhaustible.
"2.18 These bodies of the embodied Self, Which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore fight, O Arjuna.","All these bodies of this immortal, eternal, divine soul have been called destructive, therefore, O India, fight!"
"2.19 He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks It is slain, neither of them ï1knowsï1. It slays not, nor is It slain.","Both those who think that the soul is dead and those who think that it is dead do not know, for the soul is neither dead nor killed."
"2.20 It is not born, nor does It ever die; after having been, It again ceases not to be; unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed.","2. 20 The soul is neither born nor dead in any time, nor is it once again destitute. The soul is eternal, eternal, eternal and ancient, even if the body is destroyed, it is not destroyed."
"2.21 Whosoever knows It to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and inexhaustible, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain?","How will the soul who knows this spirit as incorruptible, eternal and inexhaustible kill and kill whom?"
"2.22 Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new.","As man wears other new garments by abandoning old ones, so the deity receives other new ones by abandoning old bodies."
"2.23 Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not.","This soul cannot be cut off by weapons, nor can fire burn it; water cannot make it thin, nor can air dry it."
"2.24 This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted, nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and ancient.","For this soul is good (cannot be cut off), unpleasant (cannot be burned), unclean (cannot be dirty) and unpleasant (cannot be pleasurable); it is eternal, universal, permanent, constant and eternal."
"2.25 This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve.","It is said that this soul is invisible, unconscious and invincible; therefore it is not proper for you to mourn to know it in this way."
"2.26 But even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve.","And even if you consider the Spirit to be eternally born and eternally dying, O great beast, it is not right for you to mourn in this way."
"2.27 For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve.","2. 27. The death of the born is certain, and the birth of the dead is certain; therefore do not grieve over what is unfailing and inevitable."
"2.28 Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifested again in their end. What is there to grieve about?",All creatures live before birth and after death in an invisible state and manifest themselves in the middle. Then what is there to worry or grieve about?
"2.29 One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet having heard, none understands It at all.",Some see it as a wonder; some say it as a wonder; and some other men hear it as a wonder; and yet no one knows it by hearing.
"2.30 This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is ever indestructible, O Arjuna; therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.","2. 30. O India, this divine spirit is always in everyone 's bodies, so it is not proper for all beings to mourn you."
"2.31 Further, having regard to thy duty, shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.","And you should not be distracted by your own religion, for there is no more beneficial duty for Kshatriya than a religious war."
"2.32 Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna! who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself as an open door to heaven.","2. 32 And, O Path, the blessed Kshatriyas find this kind of war in themselves and open doors to heaven."
"2.33 But if thou wilt not fight this righteous war, then having abandoned thine own duty and fame, thou shalt incur sin.","And if you do not accept this war of religion, you will lose self - religion and glory and gain sin."
"2.34 People, too, will recount thy everlasting dishonour; and to one who has been honoured, dishonour is worse than death.",And all will call you a disgrace that lasts for a long time; and for a noble man a disgrace is more than death.
2.35 The great car-warriors will think that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear; and thou wilt be lightly held by them who have thought much of thee.,"And for those to whom you are most worthy, you will now receive vanity, and the Maharthi people will think you have retired from the war for fear."
"2.36 Thy enemies also, cavilling at thy power, will speak many abusive words. What is more painful than this?","Your enemies will say many utterances denying your righteousness, but what will be worse than that?"
"2.37 Slain, thou wilt obtain heaven; victorious, thou wilt enjoy the earth; therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight.","2. 37. To die in battle you will get heaven or to win you will enjoy the earth; now, come on, decide to fight."
"2.38 Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shalt not incur sin.","2. 38. Prepare for war by equating good and evil, gain and loss and glory; so you will not sin."
"2.39 This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdon concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action.",2. 39. You have been called the knowledge of the world and now listen to the knowledge of the Yoga with which you will be able to destroy the Karmabund.
"2.40 In this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm (production of contrary results or transgression). Even a little of this knowledge (even a little practice of this Yoga) protects one from great fear.",2. 40. There is no corruption and every fault. The little practice of this religion (yoga) also protects from great fear.
"2.41 Here, O joy of the Kurus, there is but a single one-pointed determination; many-branched and endless are the thoughts of the irresolute.","2. 41 - LRB - Dear Kurunadan - RRB -, there is one definite intelligence in this subject, the wisdoms of the ignorant men are very different and infinite - RRB -."
"2.42 Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, taking pleasure in the eulogising words of the Vedas, O Arjuna, saying, ""There is nothing else.""",2. 42. “He who speaks the praises of the goddess is in the Vedic faith. There is nothing more than that. ”
"2.43 Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, (they utter speech which is directed to ends) leading to new births as the result of their works, and prescribe various methods abounding in specific actions, for the attainment of pleasure and power.",2. 43. With desires? Those who consider heaven to be the best describe many acts of enjoyment and divinity which (in fact) give birth to fruit.
"2.44 For those who are attached to pleasure and power, whose minds are drawn away by such teaching, ï1thatï1 determinate reason is not formed which is steadily bent on meditation and Samadhi (superconscious state).","There is no definite intelligence in the ends of men who have the desire of enjoyment and fertility, i. e. they are unable to practise meditation."
"2.45 The Vedas deal with the three attributes (of Nature); be thou above these three attributes. O Arjuna, free yourself from the pairs of opposites, and ever remain in the ality of Sattva (goodness), freed from (the thought of) acisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.","2. 45. The subject of the Arjuna Vedas relates to three qualities (to the world): Be thou three - fold, non - dual, eternal, purity - LRB - purity - RRB -, free from Yoga and become self - sufficient."
"2.46 To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.",2. 46. What is the purpose of man in a small reservoir with a full body of water? The self - knowing Brahmin has the same purpose in all the Vedas.
"2.47 Thy right is to work only, but never with its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction.","2. 47. Do you have the right only to work? Never to work. Don 't be for the sake of work, and don' t be addicted to inaction."
"2.48 Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.","Work, O Dhanjaya, by abandoning your attachment and being in Yoga in harmony between perfection and failure. This harmony is called Yoga."
"2.49 Far lower than the Yoga of wisdon is action, O Arjuna. Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are they whose motive is the fruit.","2. 49. Compared to this intelligence, karma is worse. Therefore, you, Dhanjaya, are the beggars who seek the fruit. 2. 49."
"2.50 Endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action.",2. 50. A man with a sense of equality here (in this life) renounces both virtue and sin. So get used to yoga.
"2.51 The wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil.","2. 51. Wise men with intelligence, who have abandoned the fruit of works and are freed from the birth - form boundary, are given the title of innocence. 2. 51."
"2.52 When thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard.","2. 52. When your intellect passes through the folds of the mind, you will receive the Nirved from all that is audible and heard. 2. 52."
"2.53 When thy intellect, which is perplexed by the Veda text, which thou hast read, shall stand immovable and steady in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-realisation.","2. 53. When your intellect, which has been distracted from listening to various subjects, becomes stationary and stable in the self, you will attain Yoga."
"2.54 Arjuna said  What, O Krishna, is the description of him who has steady wisdom, and is merged in the superconscious state? How does one of steady wisdom speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?","Arjun said - What is the characteristic of a man with a fixed intellect in Kesava Samadhi? How does a man speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?"
"2.55 The Blessed Lord said  When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom.","The Lord said, ""O Parth, when the soul renounces all desires in the mind and is satisfied with the spirit itself, he calls it the situation - conscious."
"2.56 He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures, and is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.","In sorrow, whose mind is not awakened, in happiness, whose husband is deprived, whose mind is devoid of anger, fear and wrath, he is called the saint - wise."
"2.57 He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, who neither rejoices not hastes, his wisdom is fixed.","2. 57. Who, everywhere, is devoid of all affection, does not rejoice or hate the good and evil things? His wisdom is noble."
"2.58 When, like the tortoise which withdraws on all sides its limbs, he withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, then his wisdom becomes steady.","As the cockroach gathers his organs, so does this man when he overpowers his senses from all sides with the matters of the senses, his intelligence remains fixed."
2.59 The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man leaving the longing (behind); but his longing also turns away on seeing the Supreme.,"2. 59. The subjects are removed from the Nirhari Dehi man, but not the राग, the राग of this (man) is also removed when one sees the Supreme Element."
"2.60 The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise man though he be striving (to control them).",2. 60. These senses are strongly overtaking the mind of the wise man in his attempts at restraint.
"2.61 Having restrained them all he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control.","2. 61. Be submissive to all these senses and be wise. The man whose senses are under his control, his wisdom is honoured."
"2.62 When a man thinks of the objects, attachment for them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises.",2. 62. Does the man who thinks about matters have attachment to it? Desire arises from desire and anger from desire.
2.63 From anger comes delusion; from delusion loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; from the destruction of discrimination he perishes.,"2.63. Anger results in envy and envy leads to memory confusion. When the memory is confused, the intellect is destroyed, and when the intellect is destroyed, man is destroyed."
"2.64 But the self-controlled man, moving among the objects with the senses under restraint and free from attraction and repulsion, attains to peace.",2. 64. Self - united (the spiritual soul) the man receives the happiness (prasada) of subjecting himself to the things by the senses without रागद्वैष.
2.65 In that peace all pains are destroyed; for the intellect of the tranil-minded soon becomes steady.,"2. 65. In the presence of Prasad all sorrows cease, and soon the intelligence of the happy man ceases."
"2.66 There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady and to the unsteady no meditation is possible, and to the unmeditative there can be no peace, and to the man who has no peace, how can there be happiness?",2. 66 - LRB - without restraint - RRB - the unwise man does not have knowledge and the unwise man does not have the capacity for emotion and attention. The unfeeling man does not have peace. The restless man does not have happiness.
"2.67 For the mind, which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters.","Every man takes the boat like the air in the water, and the same sense which the mind follows among the senses which are absent in matters takes the same sense of its wisdom."
"2.68 Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from sense-objects.","Therefore, O Mahabharata, the man whose senses are all subject to the subjects of the senses, his intellect is fixed."
"2.69 That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man is awake; when all beings are awake, that is night for the Muni (sage) who sees.","2. 69. The night which is for all the lovers, in which the soul awakes, and where all the creatures awake, is the night for the seeker of the saint."
"2.70 He attains peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean which, filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the man who is full of desires.","2. 70. As the waters of the boundless sea, full of all sides, are swallowed up, so the man who is swallowed up in it by his desires for peace, and not by his desires for pleasures."
"2.71 That man attains peace who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without the sense of mine and without egoism.","2. 71. The man who gives up all desires and walks without affection and reluctance, he finds peace."
"2.72 This is the Brahmic seat (eternal state), O son of Pritha. Attaining to this, none is deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life, one attains to oneness with Brahman.","2. 72. This is the Brahmin position. The soul does not become enchanted by it. Even at the end of the time, in this devotion, the Brahman is unified (with Brahman)."
"3.1 Arjuna said  If Thou thinkest that knowledge is superior to action, O Krishna, why then, O Kesava, dost Thou ask me to engage in this terrible action?","3. 1. 2. If you believe that knowledge is superior to action, why do you entice me to this evil action, Keshav?"
"3.2 With this apparently perplexing speech, Thou confusest, as it were, my understanding; therefore tell me that one way for certain by which I may attain bliss.","You are enchanting my intelligence with this mixed sentence, so say with certainty the one (path) from which I can obtain the supreme credit."
"3.3 The Blessed Lord said  In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one; the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogins.","3. 3. Sri Bhagwan said, “He is faithful, Arjun. ” In this verse, two types of faithfulness have been mentioned by me earlier: from the knowledge Yoga of the disciples and from the karma Yoga of the yogis."
3.4 Not by non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection.,"3. 4. Man does not get enlightenment by not doing works, nor does he get perfection by sinking in works."
3.5 Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for everyone is made to act helplessly indeed by the alities born of Nature.,"3. 5. No man can ever live without action for a single moment, because action is carried out by all (mankind) who are blessed by the qualities of nature."
"3.6 He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he of deluded understanding is called a hypocrite.",3. 6. The foolish intellect which takes possession of the male organs and remembers the pleasures of the senses from the mind is called the deceitful.
"3.7 But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels.","3. 7. But Arjuna, who exercises karmayoga through the untouched senses by subjecting the mind to the senses, is the best."
"3.8 Do thou perform (thy) bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction and even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for thee by inaction.","3. 8. 2. Work according to your duties, for inaction is better than inaction. Your inaction will not suffice to sustain your body."
"3.9 The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment.","3. 9. 2. In addition to the acts performed for the sacrifice, the man is engaged in other acts which are bound by the acts, so let him abandon the attachment and act accordingly for the sake of the sacrifice."
"3.10 The Creator, having in the beginning (of creation) created mankind together with sacrifice, said, ""By this shall ye propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires (the cow which yields all the desired objects).""","3. 10. 2. Prajapati (Creator) created the people with the sacrifice, etc., and said, “By this sacrifice you will gain growth, and this sacrifice will fulfil your desires. ”"
"3.11 With this do ye nourish the gods and may those gods nourish you; thus nourishing one another, ye shall attain to the highest good.","You shall advance the gods by this sacrifice, and they shall advance you. Thus you shall receive the supreme credit for your mutual advancement."
"3.12 The gods, nourished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. So, he who enjoys the objects given by the gods without offering (in return) to them, is verily a thief.",The gods fed by the sacrifice will give you good enjoyment. The enjoyment given by them is surely a thief.
3.13 The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are freed from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food (only) for their own sake verily eat sin.,"The best men who eat the remainder of the sacrifice are free from sins, but those who eat only for themselves eat only sins."
3.14 From food come forth beings; from rain food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain and sacrifice is born of action.,"All living creatures are born of grain, the origin of grain is from leaf, the origin of leaf is from sacrifice and the origin of sacrifice is from works."
"3.15 Know thou that action comes from Brahma and Brahma comes from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervading (Brahma) ever rests in sacrifice.","3. 15. Action originates from Brahman and Brahman is expressed by the literal principle. Therefore, the universal Brahman is always embedded in the sacrifice."
"3.16 He who does not follow here the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Arjuna.","3.16. The man who does not follow the cycle thus conducted here, the sinful man who enters the earthly senses lives in vain."
"3.17 But for that man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self and who is content in the Self alone, verily there is nothing to do.","But there is no duty for a man who is satisfied in the spirit, who is satisfied in the spirit, who is satisfied in the spirit."
3.18 For him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object.,"3.18. In this world, the man has no purpose from what he has done and from what he has not done, nor is he dependent on the devil for anything."
"3.19 Therefore without attachment, do thou always perform action which should be done; for by performing action without attachment man reaches the Supreme.","3.19. Therefore, always do duty and act accordingly without being destitute, for the destitute man who acts receives the Spirit."
3.20 Janaka and others attained perfection verily by action only; even with a view to the protection of the masses thou shouldst perform action.,3. 20. 2. Gyanadi (the wise man) also sees the folk collection (the preservation of the world); you are capable of action.
"3.21 Whatsoever a great man does, that the other men also do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world (mankind) follows.",3.21. The best man acts as others do; the man who proves something follows him.
"3.22 There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that should be done by Me, nor is there anything unattained that should be attained; yet I engage Myself in action.","Although I do not have any duty in the vision and I do not have anything that can be obtained, I treat in action."
"3.23 For, should I not ever engage Myself in action, unwearied, men would in every way follow My path, O Arjuna.","If I were to be warned, perhaps I would not be engaged in the work, and all men would follow my way."
3.24 These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; I should be the author of confusion of castes and destruction of these beings.,"3. 24 If I do not act, all these peoples will be destroyed; and I will be the perpetrator of corruption and the perpetrator of destruction of this people."
"3.25 As the ignorant men act from attachment to action, O Bharata (Arjuna), so should the wise act without attachment, wishing the welfare of the world.","3. 25 - O India! As the ignorant who are addicted to work do, so should the learned man be addicted and work for the sake of the welfare of the people."
"3.26 Let no wise man unsettle the mind of ignorant people who are attached to action; he should engage them in all actions, himself fulfilling them with devotion.","3.26. The wise man, do not confuse the intelligence of the ignorant who are in the works, do the same to them by himself (in devotion) and conduct the works accordingly."
"3.27 All actions are wrought in all cases by the alities of Nature only. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks, ""I am the doer.""","3.27. All works are done by the qualities of nature, the ego - enchanted man assumes, ""I am the doer."""
"3.28 But he who knows the Truth, O mighty-armed (Arjuna), about the divisions of the alities and (their) functions, knowing that the Gunas as senses move amidst the Gunas as the sense-objects, is not attached.","But, O Mahabaho, a wise man who knows the truth of the department of virtues and works, knowing that virtues behave in virtues, is not persuaded."
3.29 Those deluded by the alities of Nature are attached to the functions of the alities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one who is of imperfect knowledge.,"3.29. Purushas enchanted by the qualities of nature are addicted to virtue and action, let not the Purusha who has the full knowledge deceive those who have the incomplete knowledge."
"3.30 Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred in the Self, free from hope and egoism, and from (mental) fever, do thou fight.","3. 30. Fight with all your deeds in me, without hope and affection, without anger."
"3.31 Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine with faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from actions.","3. 31. Those who, without guilt, without intellect and with devotion, always follow my teachings with reverence, are free from works."
"3.32 But those who carp at My teaching and do not practise it, deluded of all knowledge, and devoid of discrimination, know them to be doomed to destruction.","But those who do not follow this view of mine, the fools who are inclined to blame, will be destroyed by all these knowledge."
"3.33 Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature; beings will follow Nature; what can 
restraint do?","3. 33 The wise man also strives according to his own nature. All creatures go to their own nature, then what will he do with them?"
"3.34 Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses; let none come under their sway; for, they are his foes.",3.34. The senses (i. e. each sense) are envious of the subject (in the mind); man should not be subject to them; for they are his (human) enemies.
"3.35 Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear (is productive of danger).",3. 35. Worship of self - religion without merit is better than properly respected super - religion; death in self - religion is beneficial (but) super - religion is frightening.
"3.36 Arjuna said  But impelled by what does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O Varshneya (Krishna), constrained as it were, by force?","Arjuna said: - O wise man! Who is it then by whom this man, unwilling as he was forced, is motivated to commit sin?"
"3.37 The Blessed Lord said  It is desire, it is anger both of the ality of Rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as the foe here (in this world).","3. 37 Sri Bhagwan said: 'This is the desire which has arisen in Rajoguna, this is the anger, this is the great sorrow, and this is the great sorrow, this is the enemy you know here."
"3.38 As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by the amnion, so is this enveloped by that.","As smoke covers the wall with fire and dust, and as the foetus covers the womb, so it is covered by it."
"3.39 O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire.","Like fire, which is difficult to satisfy, this work form is endowed with knowledge by this eternal enemy of the wise."
"3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom.","The senses, mind and intelligence are called its dwelling places; it is through them that the divine soul is enchanted by the covering of knowledge."
"3.41 Therefore, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation.","3. 41. Therefore, Arjuna, you must first conquer the senses and destroy the corrupter of knowledge and science."
3.42 They say that the senses are superior (to the body); superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; one who is superior even to the intellect is He (the Self).,"It is said that beyond (the body) are the senses; beyond the senses is the mind and beyond the mind is the intellect, and that which is beyond the intellect is the soul."
"3.43 Thus knowing Him Who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to coner.","Thus, by knowing the soul beyond the intellect and by conquering the soul by the soul, O Mahabash, kill this evil enemy."
4.1 The Blessed Lord said  I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku.,4. 1. Sri Bhagwan said - - I said this invincible Yoga to Viswana (the sun god); Viswana said to Manu; Manu said to Ikshaku.
"4.2 This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by long lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa (burner of the foes).","Thus, this Yoga, which has been acquired from tradition, has been passed on to the kings, but, Lord, the Yoga has been lost here for a long time."
"4.3 That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for thou art My devotee and My friend; it is the supreme secret.","This is what I told you today, because you are my devotees and friends. This is the best secret."
"4.4 Arjuna said  Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to understand that Thou taughtest this Yoga in the beginning?","Arjun said, ""You are born after the past, and the Vivasvan is from the past, so how can I know that you said (this Yoga) in the past?"""
"4.5 The Blessed Lord said  Many births of Mine have passed as well as of thine, O Arjuna; I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa (scorcher of foes).","4. 5. Sri Bhagwan said, “O Arjuna, many of you and I have been born, (but) O Lord, I know them all and you do not. ”"
"4.6 Though I am unborn, of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing My own Nature, I am born by My own Maya.","Though I am the invincible and incorruptible nature and the God of all beings, I am born from my illusion by keeping my nature under my control."
"4.7 Whenever there is decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then I manifest Myself.","4. 7. O India, whenever there is an increase in the harm and injustice of religion, I declare myself."
"4.8 For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked and for the establishment of righteousness, I am born in every age.","4. 8. I am anxious at every age for the protection of saintly men, the destruction of wrongdoers, and the establishment of religion."
"4.9 He who thus know, in their true light, My divine birth and action, having abandoned the body, is not born again, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.","4. 9. O Arjuna, my birth and my work are divine, so that the soul who knows is not born again by abandoning the body; it is born to me."
"4.10 Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being.","4.10. Many men who are my refuge, mindless of rage, fear and anger, have received my form, sanctified by knowledge and penance."
"4.11 In whatever way men approach Me even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna.","I give grace to those who cry to Me as I do; all men follow My way, O Path."
4.12 Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods; because success is ickly attained by men through action.,4.1.2. (Normal man) here worships the gods who desire the fruits of the works; for in the people the fruits of the works are soon obtained.
4.13 The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma; though I am the author thereof know Me as non-doer and immutable.,"4.1.3. The Chaturvanya has been created by me from the department of virtues and deeds. Though I am its creator, you know me to be the creator and immortal."
"4.14 Actions do not taint Me, nor have I a desire for the fruit of actions. He who knows Me thus is not bound by actions.","Action does not bind me; nor do I belong to the fruit of action. Thus, whoever knows me is not bound by action either."
"4.15 Having known this, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action; therefore do thou also perform action, as did the ancients in days of yore.",4.15. The former free men have also done so knowingly; so do you also the works always done by the ancestors.
"4.16 What is action? What is inaction? As to this even the wise are confused. Therefore I shall teach thee such action (the nature of action and inaction) by knowing which thou shalt be liberated from the evil (of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death).","4. 16. What is karma and what is un karma? The wise men are also confused about this. Therefore, I will tell you karma, which you will know and which you will be freed from evil."
"4.17 For verily (the true nature) of action (enjoined by the scriptures) should be known, also (that) 
of forbidden (or unlawful) action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature (path) of action.",4.17. You must know the nature of action and also the nature of inaction; you must know both the vices and the inactions (because the pace of action is intense).
"4.18 He who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a Yogi and performer of all actions.","Whoever sees in action in inaction and in action in inaction, he is wise in men, he is the Yogi who does all actions."
"4.19 He whose undertakings are all devoid of desires and (selfish) purposes and whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge,  him the wise call a sage.","4.19. A man whose all works are devoid of desire and will, such as the works burned by the knowledge form of fire, is called the knowledgeable Pandit."
"4.20 Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of the action, ever content, depending on nothing, he does not do anything though engaged in activity.","4. 20. The man who is devoid of action, eternally content and devoid of all recourse does nothing even though he is engaged in action."
"4.21 Without hope and with the mind and the self controlled, having abandoned all covetousness, doing mere bodily action, he incurs no sin.","4.2.1. Who is hopeless and who has tempered the mind and soul (spirit), who has renounced all virtues, such a man does not receive sin even though he is physically working."
"4.22 Content with what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposites and envy, even-minded in success and failure, though acting, he is not bound.","A man who is satisfied only with what he receives, who is free from conflicts, from the past and from misfortune, who is equal in perfection and in imperfection, is not bound by action."
"4.23 To one who is devoid of attchment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, who works for the sake of sacrifice (for the sake of God), the whole action is dissolved.","4.23. Whoever is selfless and free, whoever is in conscious knowledge, all the works of such a man who practices for the sacrifice are taken away."
4.24 Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in action.,"4. 2 4. 2 The consecration (i. e. the means of consecration) is Brahman and the holy (spiritual or breathable matter) is also Brahman; the breath which is breathed by the Brahman - shaped Actor in the Brahman - shaped Fire is also Brahman. Thus, the destination of the Brahman - shaped Purusha in the Brahman - shaped Action is also Brahman."
4.25 Some Yogies perform sacrifice to the gods alone; while others (who have realised the Self) offer the self as sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman alone.,"Some yogis do the sacrifice of the gods, and others (the scholars) burn the sacrifice in the Brahma form of fire."
4.26 Some again offer the organ of hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses.,"4.26. The other (yoga) auditory subjects breathe all the senses into the temperate fire, and the other (people) vocabulary subjects into the sensory fire."
4.27 Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath (vital energy or Prana) in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint kindled by knowledge.,"4.27. The second ( Yogijan) brings the works of all the senses and of life into the fire of self - restraint, revealed by knowledge."
"4.28 Others again offer wealth, austerity and Yoga as sacrifice, while the ascetics of self-restraint and rigid vows offer study of scriptures and knowledge as sacrifice.","4.28. Some are mass - conscious, तपei - conscious and yoga - conscious; others are hard - fasting yoga - conscious and knowledge - conscious."
"4.29 Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the outgoing, restraining the course of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the restraint of the breath.","4.29. Others ( Yogis) inhabit the breath of life in the breath of breath, and in the breath of life in the breath of breath, and by stopping the movement of life and breath, they perceive life as being in the same direction."
"4.30 Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in life-breaths. All these are knowers of sacrifice, whose sins are destroyed by sacrifice.","4. 30. The other regular - feeding souls are burned in the souls. They are all those who know the sacrifice, whose sins have been destroyed by the sacrifice."
"4.31 Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for the man who does not perform sacrifice; how then can he have the other, O Arjuna?","4. 31 - LRB - Dear Kurukshreshtha - RRB -, the man who receives the residual nectar of the sacrifice comes to the eternal Brahman. The man who does not receive the sacrifice does not get this world, so how does the world get?"
"4.32 Thus, manifold sacrifices are spread out before Brahman (literally) at the mouth or face of Brahman). Know them all as born of action and thus knowing, thou shalt be liberated.","There are many such sacrifices in the mouth of Brahman, in the Vedas. Know them all as a result of works, and you will be free to know."
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"4. 3 3. O Parantapa, the knowledgeist is superior to the sacrifice of matter. O Parth, all all works end in knowledge, that is to say, knowledge is their supremacy."
"4.34 Know That by long prostration, by estion and by service; the wise who have realised the Truth will instruct thee in (that) knowledge.","Know him (knowledge) by observing, questioning and serving (beside the Guru); these principled wise men will preach to you knowledge."
"4.35 Knowing ï1thatï1 thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again get deluded like this; and by that thou shalt see all beings in thy Self and also in Me.","4. 35 You will not find such love again in knowing Him, and by Him, O Pandavas, you will see all the devils in your self and in me."
"4.36 Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt verily cross all sins by the raft of knowledge.","If you are more sinful than all sinners, you will surely inherit all sins by the vessel of knowledge."
"4.37 As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.","As the burning fire consumes the enlightenment, so, O Arjuna, the fire of knowledge consumes all works."
"4.38 Verily, there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga finds it in the Self in time.","There is, of course, nothing in this world as holy as knowledge. It is the soul itself that receives it in the Yoga in the (appropriate) time."
"4.39 The man who is full of faith, who is devoted to it, and who has subdued the senses obtains (this) knowledge; and having obtained the knowledge he attains at once to the supreme peace.","4.39. The faithful, the ready and the sensed man receives knowledge. By receiving knowledge, he soon receives the supreme peace."
"4.40 The ignorant the faithless, the doubting self goes to destruction; there is neither this world nor the other, nor happiness for the doubting.","4. 40. The ignorant and faithless and suspicious man perishes, for the suspicious man (of them) this is neither a world nor a heaven nor happiness."
"4.41 He who has renounced actions by Yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, and who is self-possessed  actions do not bind him, O Arjuna.","4. 41. Whoever has set up the works by Yoga, by knowledge whose doubts have been destroyed, does not bind such a selfish man, O Dhananjay! the works."
"4.42 Therefore with the sword of the knowledge (of the Self) cut asunder the doubt of the self born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, and take refuge in Yoga. Arise, O Arjuna.","Therefore, O India, take up the refuge of Yoga and cut off the self - suspicion arising from the ignorance in your heart."
"5.1 Arjuna said  Renunciation of actions, O Krishna, Thou praisest, and again Yoga. Tell me conclusively that which is the better of the two.","Arjun said, Krishna, you praise the practice of karmas and then the Yoga. Tell me of one of these which is surely worthy of credit."
"5.2 The Blessed Lord said  Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.",5. 2. Shri Bhagwan said - Karma Sansanna and Karma Yoga are both supremely beneficial; but in both of them Karma Sansanna is better than Karma Yoga.
"5.3 He should be known as a perpertual Sannyasi who neither hates nor desires; for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily set free from bondage.","5. 3. The man who hates no one or desires no one is always to be understood as a Sanyasi; for, O Mahabharata, the man who is free from conflicts is easily freed from bondage."
"5.4 Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action or the performance of action as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one obtains the fruits of both.","5. 4. The child, the child - mind, considers Sanshya (Sanshya) and Yoga to be different; the man, who is properly situated in any one of them, receives the fruit of both."
"5.5 That place which is reached by the Sankhyas or the Jnanis is reached by the Yogis (Karma Yogis). He sees, who sees knowledge and the performance of action (Karma Yoga) as one.","5. 5 The place which is taken by the wise also reaches the place of the Karma Yogi. Therefore, whoever sees Samkhya and Yoga as one, he sees (in fact)."
"5.6 But renunciation, O mighty-armed Arjuna, is hard to attain without Yoga; the Yoga-harmonised sage ickly goes to Brahman.","But, O Mahabharata, without Yoga it is difficult to attain Sanshya; the mindful soul with Yoga is soon attainable to the Divine."
"5.7 He who is devoted to the path of action, whose mind is ite pure, who has conered the self, who has subdued his senses and who realises his Self as the Self in all beings, though acting, is not tainted.","5. 7. The Purusha, who is a Yoga, a pure embodiment, under the yoke of the body, experiencing unity with the spirit in the senses and in the flesh, is not bound by them in action."
"5.8 ""I do nothing at all,"" thus would the harmonised knower of Truth think  seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing.","5. 8. The man with the principle will think (i. e. know) that ""I do nothing but act"" by seeing, hearing, touching, suffocating, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing."
"5.9 Speaking, letting go, seizing, opening and closing the eyes  convinced that the senses move among the sense-objects.","He who speaks, gives up, receives and opens and closes his eyes (he) knows for certain that all the senses are circulating in their own subjects."
"5.10 He who does actions, offering them to Brahman, and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, just as a lotus-leaf is not tainted by water.",5. 10. The man who dedicates all his works to Brahman and renounces attachment does not sin like the leaves of the lotus.
"5.11 Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body, mind, intellect, and even by the senses, for the purification of the self.","Yogis, by renunciation of attachment by the body, mind, intelligence and senses, work for self - purification."
"5.12 The united one (the well poised or the harmonised) having abandoned the fruit of action attains to the eternal peace: the non-united only (the unsteady or the unbalanced) impelled by desire, attached to the fruit, is bound.",5.1.2. The possessed man gets the supreme peace by abandoning the fruit; and the un possessed man is consumed by the desire embedded in the fruit.
"5.13 Mentally renouncing all actions and self-controlled, the embodied one rests happily in the nine-gated city, neither acting nor causing others (body and senses) to act.","5. 1. 3. By concentrating all his activities in the mind, the harmonious man does not work nor do them, living happily in the city of body form with a new entrance."
"5.14 Neither agency nor actions does the Lord create for the world, nor union with the fruits of actions. But it is Nature that acts.","5. 1. 4 The Lord (God) does not create the combination of charity, work and fruit for the people only. But nature does (all)"
"5.15 The Lord takes neither the demerit nor even the merit of any; knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, thery beings are deluded.","The Lord God accepts neither the sin nor the good deeds of any one; knowledge is covered by ignorance, and all beings are enchanted by it."
"5.16 But to those whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self, like the sun, knowledge reveals the Supreme (Brahman).","But for those whose ignorance is destroyed by self - knowledge, it reveals the Spirit, like the sun."
"5.17 Their intellect absorbed in That, their self being That, established in That, with That for their supreme goal, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by knowledge.","5.17. Those whose intellect is in that (the spirit), whose mind is adapted, whose devotion is in that (the Brahman), whose ultimate aim is, through knowledge, the sinless souls are brought to perdition, i. e. they are not reborn."
"5.18 Sages look with an eal eye on a Brahmana endowed with learning and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, and even on a dog and an outcaste.","5. 18. (They) see the same principle in the Brahmins of knowledge and wisdom, as in the cows, the elephants, the fowls and the panda."
5.19 Even here (in this world) birth (everything) is overcome by those whose minds rest in eality; Brahman is spotless indeed and eal; therefore they are established in Brahman.,"5.19. Those whose minds are in equality are conquered by this circle; for Brahman is innocent and equal, therefore they are in Brahman."
"5.20 Resting in Brahman, with steady intellect and undeluded, the knower of Brahman neither rejoiceth on obtaining what is pleasant nor grieveth on obtaining what is unpleasant.","5.20. Whoever is in the static, unmoved Brahman, the Purusha Brahman, does not rejoice by receiving the beloved thing and does not exult by finding the unpleasant."
5.21 With the self unattached to external contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in    the meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness.,5.21. A man who has no attachment to external matters finds happiness only in the soul; a man who has a mind enclosed in the mind of Brahman finds eternal happiness.
"5.22 The enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for they have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna; the wise man does not rejoice in them.","The enjoyments that arise from the coincidence of the senses and subjects are for the sake of evil, for they are the first and the last. The wise man is not among them."
"5.23 He who is able, while still here (in this world) to withstand, before the liberation from the body, the impulse born out of desire and anger  he is a Yogi, he is a happy man.",The man who is able to withstand the velocity generated by work and anger before giving up his body in this world is a yogi and a happy man.
"5.24 He who is happy within, who rejoices within, and who is illuminated within, that Yogi attains absolute freedom or Moksha, himself becoming Brahman.","Whoever is happy in the soul, resting in the soul and knowing in the soul, becomes a yogi in the form of the Brahman and receives the Brahman liberation, the supreme liberation."
"5.25 The sages (Rishis) obtain absolute freedom or Moksha  they whose sins have been destroyed, whose dualities (perception of dualities or experience of the pairs of opposites) are torn asunder, who are self-controlled, and intent on the welfare of all beings.","5.25. They are the sages who receive salvation - whose sins have been destroyed, who are in the interest of destruction, forgiveness and for the good of all beings."
"5.26 Absolute freedom (or Brahmic bliss) exists on all sides for those self-controlled ascetics who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their thoughts and who have realised the Self.","5.26. Freedom (or Brahmananda) exists everywhere for those who are devoid of work and anger, restrained and aware of the soul."
"5.27 Shutting out (all) external contacts and fixing the gaze between the eyrow, ealising the outgoing and incoming breaths moving within the nostrils.","5.27. By keeping out the external matters and placing the sight of the eyes in the midst of the beetle and equating the life circulating in the nose and the breathing air,"
"5.28 With the senses, the mind and the intellect (ever) controlled, having liberation as his supreme goal, free from desire, fear and anger  the sage is verily liberated for ever.","5.28. A liberated saint whose senses, mind and intellect are concentrated is free from desire, fear and anger."
"5.29 He who knows Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds and the friend of all beings, attains to peace.",5.29. I get peace by knowing Yajna and the devotee of तपs and the great God of all the peoples and the friend of all the devils.
6.1 The Blessed Lord said  He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions  he is a Sannyasi and a Yogi; not he who is without fire and without action.,"Shri Bhagwan said - A man who does duty without relying on the fruit of his deeds is a Sanyasi and a yogi, not one who has renounced only fire and activities."
"6.2 Do thou, O Arjuna, know Yoga to be that which they call renunciation; no one verily becomes a Yogi who has not renounced thoughts.","6. 2 O Pandavas! Whosoever is called Sanyasi, you should think of him as Yoga; for there is no soul Yogi who does not give up his wills."
"6.3 For a sage who wishes to attain to Yoga, action is said to be the means; for the same sage who has attained to Yoga, inaction (iescence) is said to be the means.","6. 3. 2. For the monk who wishes to join the Yoga, it is said to be a means of doing only, and for the same man who joins the Yoga, it is said to be a means of Shanti."
"6.4 When a man is not attached to the sense-objects or to actions, having renounced all thoughts, then he is said to have attained to Yoga.","6.4. When the saint is neither addicted to the matters of the senses nor to the works, the saint of all wills is called Yoghur."
"6.5 One should raise oneself by one's Self alone; let not one lower oneself; for the Self alone is the friend of oneself, and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself.",Man should save himself by himself and not fall; for the soul is the friend of the soul and the soul (man himself) is the enemy of the soul.
"6.6 The Self is the friend of the self of him by whom the self has been conered by the Self, but to the unconered self, this Self stands in the position of an enemy, like an (external) foe.","Whoever has conquered the soul ( Indras, Adis) by the soul, the soul of the man is his friend, but for the senseless the soul is like the enemy."
"6.7 The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful is balanced in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as also in honour and dishonour.","6. 7. The peace that exists in the cold, the hot, the happy, the miserable and the humble, as the Spirit is to the soul sufficiently situated, i. e., self - existent."
"6.8 The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom (of the Self), who has conered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonied (i.e., is said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi).","The yogi who is satisfied with knowledge and science, who is unimpaired and senseless, who is like clay, stone and earth, is called possessed."
"6.9 He who is of the same mind to the good-hearted, friends, enemies, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful, the relatives, the righteous and the unrighteous, excels.","The man who is good, friend, enemy, sad, mediator, hater and enemy, and equal in spirits and sinners, is superior."
"6.10 Let the Yogi try constantly to keep the mind steady, remaining in solitude, alone, with the mind and the body controlled, and free from hope and covetousness.","6.10. The Yogi, who restrains the body and mind, stays alone in a lonely place, frees himself from hope and prejudice and keeps the mind constant in the spirit."
"6.11 In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of a cloth, a skin and Kusa-grass, one over the other.","6. 11. 12. In a clean (clean) land, the Kusha, the Mrigasala and the garments on it shall be laid, such that the seat shall be fixed neither too high nor too low...."
"6.12 There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and the senses controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practise Yoga for the purification of the self.","There (seated) concentrate the mind, practice yoga for the self - purification imposed on the functions of the conscious and the senses."
"6.13 Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and still, gazing at the tip of his nose, without looking around.","The eye, holding the head and the cervix equal and constant, fixed, seeing the forehead of his nose and not looking in other directions."
"6.14 Serene-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari, having controlled the mind, thinking of Me and balanced in mind, let him sit, having Me as his supreme goal.","6.14. I should sit in a place of peaceful innerness, fearlessness and brahmo - charity, calm my mind, place the psyche in me, and see myself as the ultimate goal."
"6.15 Thus always keeping the mind balanced, the Yogi, with the mind controlled, attains to the peace abiding in Me, which culminates in liberation.","6.15. In this way, the Yogi of the tempered mind, always striving to stabilise the mind, finds peace in the form of the supreme liberation in me."
"6.16 Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is (always) awake, O Arjuna.","But, Arjuna, this Yoga is not possible for a man who eats too much or does not eat at all, and who sleeps too much or is always awake."
"6.17 Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation (such 
as walking, etc.), who is moderate in exertion in actions, who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness.","6.17. Yoga is a two - wise remedy for a man who is full of food and devotion, striving as he can, and resting and awakening within the limits."
"6.18 When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self only, free from longing for all the objects of desires, then it is said, 'He is united'.","At a time when the enforced psyche ceases to exist in its own form and becomes untouchable of all things, it is called Yogi."
"6.19 As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker  to such is compared the Yogi of controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self (or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self).","As the lamp - rod in the place of the air without vibration becomes unconscious, the same parable is said of the chitta of the yogi who is orphaned while practicing yoga."
"6.20 When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga attains to quietude and when seeing the Self by the self, he is satisfied in his own Self.","6.20. The consumption of yoga leads to a state of calming and calming, and to a state of self - satisfaction when one sees oneself."
"6.21 When he (the Yogi) feels that Infinite Bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect and which transcends the senses, and established wherein he never moves from the Reality.","The happiness which is finite, intuitive and wise, the happiness which the meditator experiences and in which it is situated, never again deviates from the element."
"6.22 Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein estabished, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.","6.22. There is no more profit for him than that which he receives, and he is not distracted by the great adversity in which he stands."
"6.23 Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practised with determination and with an undesponding mind.","6.23. There is a misunderstanding about the coincidence of the two, which should be known as the Yoga. (The Yoga which is the object of the meditation Yoga) The practitioner should practise it with determination without hesitation."
6.24 Abandoning without reserve all desires born of Sankalpa (thought and imagination) and completely restraining the whole group of the senses by the mind from all sides.,6. 2 4. 2. By abandoning all desires arising from the will and subjecting the sense community from all sides by the mind. 6. 2 4. 2.
"6.25 Little by little let him attain to ietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything.",Shani: Shani: May the patient intellect (the righteous) attain peace; do not think anything else by placing the mind in the spirit.
"6.26 From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.","This shaky and unstable mind should be tempered by the causes of its movement and put under the control of the Self, i. e. in the Self."
"6.27 Supreme Bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is ite peaceful, whose passion is ieted, who has become Brahman and who is free from sin.","Whose mind is contented, who is sinless (Akalmishm) and whose joyfulness (Abstract) is calm, such a yogi who becomes a Brahman has the best happiness."
"6.28 The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of Yoga), freed from sins, easily enjoys the Infinite Bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).","Thus, the sinless yogi, who practices the Yoga of constant attachment of the mind to the spirit, enjoys the supreme joy of the Brahma contact."
6.29 With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.,"6.29. The Yogi, who has a yogic inner being and is all - visible, sees the soul in all the devils and all the devils in the soul."
"6.30 He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he never becomes separated from Me, nor do I become separated from him.","For him who sees me everywhere and sees all in me, I am not lost (i. e. I am not far off) and he is not separated from me."
"6.31 He who, being established in unity, worships Me Who dwells in all beings, that Yogi abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living.","He who stands in the oneness of the soul, standing in all the spirits, praises me, he who is the Yogi in all forms, standing in me."
"6.32 He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees eality everywhere, be it pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi.","He who sees all things equal to himself, whether it be happiness or adversity, is regarded as the Supreme Yogi."
"6.33 Arjuna said  This Yoga of eanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance, because of the restlessness (of the mind).","Arjun said, ""Honey, this harmonious Yoga, which you said, I do not see its lasting state because of the shaking of the mind."
"6.34 The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna: I deem it as difficult to control it as to control the wind.","Because, O Krishna, this mind is chaotic and stubborn in nature and strong and firm; I consider it to be too hard to grasp, like the air."
"6.35 The Blessed Lord said  Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained.","Sri Bhagwan says, ""O Mahabharata, the mind is undoubtedly subject to agitation and hardship; but, O Kuntiputra, it can be subjected by practice and love."""
"6.36 I think Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self, but the self-controlled and striving one can attain to it by the (proper) means.","It is difficult to attain Yoga by a man of unconstrained mind, but it is possible to attain Yoga by means of a man of an independent mind, I believe."
"6.37 Arjuna said  He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, mee,t O Krishna?","Arjun said, ""O Krishna, whose mind has been driven by Yoga, what is the movement of such an unfinished effort - LRB - destiny - RRB - of such a devout man who does not achieve the perfection of Yoga?"
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"Is he not corrupted and destroyed on both sides in the way of Brahman, like a scattered cloud?"
"6.39 This doubt of mine, O Krishna, do Thou dispel completely; because it is not possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt.","You, Krishna, are the only one who is capable of cutting off my suspicion completely; for there is no one else besides you who can cut off this suspicion."
"6.40 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none, verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief.","6.40 Sri Bhagwan said, ""O Parth, that man is destroyed neither in this world nor in the Hereafter; no good worker gets evil."""
"6.41 Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there for everlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is rorn in a house of the pure and wealthy.","6.41. The wrong man is born in the house of the purely conducted lord (rich) men, having received the lands of the virtuous and lived there for a long time."
6.42 Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to obtain in this world.,"6.42. Or, (the teacher) births in the tribe of knowledgeable yogis, but such a birth is undoubtedly very rare in this world."
"6.43 Thee he comes in touch with the knowledge acired in his former body and strives more than before for perfection, O Arjuna.","6.43. He, Kurundandan, makes even greater efforts to achieve the Yoga of Self - Perfection by acquiring the knowledge that he has acquired there in the former body."
6.44 By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely wishes to know Yoga goes beyond the Brahmic word.,"6. 44. Because of the same practice, he is drawn to the Yoga of Self - Perfection. He who is merely an enlightened man of Yoga transcends the word Brahman."
"6.45 But the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually through many births, reaches the highest goal.","But a yogi who practices diligently and is cleansed from all sins and is proved by many births, then he gets the supreme speed."
"6.46 The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge (obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna.","Since the Yogi is superior to the Assams and is considered superior to those who possess knowledge (only in science) and the Yogi is superior to those who practise, be Yogi, O Arjuna."
"6.47 And among all the Yogis he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me, worships Me is deemed by Me to be the most devout.",6. 47. Every devout yogi among all yogis who praises me with the spirit of unity in me is the most appreciative of me.
"7.1 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, hear how you shall without doubt know Me fully, with the mind intent on Me, practising Yoga and taking refuge in Me.","Hear, O Parth, as you know me wholeheartedly, without any doubt, as I practise Yoga in a state of disability and exhaustion."
"7.2 I shall declare to thee in full this knowledge combined with realisation, after knowing which nothing more here remains to be known.","7. 2. I will tell you of this knowledge, including science, which there is no more to know here (in the world)."
"7.3 Among thousands of men, one perchance strives for perfection; even among those successful strivers, only one perchance knows Me in essence.","There is no man among the thousands who strive for perfection, and no man among the striving sages knows me in substance."
"7.4 Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism  thus is My Nature divided eightfold.","The earth, the water, the fire, the air and the sky and the mind, the intellect and the ego - this is my nature divided into eight types."
"7.5 This is the inferior Prakriti, O mighty-armed (Arjuna); know thou as different from it My higher Prakriti (Nature), the very life-element, by which this world is upheld.","7. 5 < s > O Mahabharata! This is the Upra Nature. Know the Para - Nature of My Life, other than this, from which this world is taken."
7.6 Know that these two (Natures) are the womb of all beings. So I am the source and dissolution of the whole universe.,Know that the homogeneous ghosts originate from these two natures. I am the origin and place of the whole world.
"7.7 There is nothing whatsoever higher than Me, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as clusters of gems on a string.",7. 7. < s > O Dhanjay! There is no other thing better than me. It has been poured into me in the whole world like a monk.
"7.8 I am the sapidity in water, O Arjuna; I am the light in the moon and the sun; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in ether and virility in men.","I am in the water, I am in the moon, I am in the sun, I am in all the Vedas, I am in the heavens, I am in the word, and I am in the men."
"7.9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the brilliance in the fire, the life in all beings, and I am the austerity in ascetics.",7. 9. I am holy in the earth and strong in the fire; I am life in all the devils and in the ascetics I am ascetic.
"7.10 Know Me, O Arjuna, as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intelligence of the intelligent; the splendour of the splendid objects am I.","7. 10. < s > O Parth, know me alone, the eternal seed of all the devils; I am the intelligence of the wise and the power of the bright."
"7.11 Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in (all) beings, I am the desire unopposed to Dharma, O Arjuna.","O Bharat Shrestha, I am the desire of the mighty and the power without attachment, and in all the devils I am the opposite of religion, i. e. the righteous work."
"7.12 Whatever beings (and objects) that are pure, active and inert, know that they proceed from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them.","Know all the essential (pure), dynamic (active) and tactical feelings that you are born of me; yet I am not among them, they are in me."
7.13 Deluded by these Natures (states or things) composed of the three alities of Nature all this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable.,I do not know the non - expendable form beyond these feelings (disorders) generated by the three virtues.
"7.14 Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, made up of the (three) alities (of Nature) is difficult to cross over; those who take refuge in Me alone, cross over this illusion.",This divine three - fold My Maya is a great double. But those who come to My shelter pass through this Maya.
7.15 The evil-doers and the deluded who are the lowest of men do not seek Me; they whose knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons.,"7.15. The evildoers, the foolish, the male men do not shout to me; those who have been deceived by illusion retain the feeling of aसुर."
"7.16 Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna, and they are the distressed, the seekr of knowledge, the seekr of wealth and the wise, O lord of the Bharatas.","“O Bharat Shrestha Arjuna! Four kinds of good - doing people (Saturitans) praise me: the Aryans, the Scientists, the Puritans and the Wise. ”"
"7.17 Of them the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels (is the best); for I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me.","Among them, too, the most eternal and devout of all is the Wise, for I love him very much and he is my favourite."
"7.18 Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in mind he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.","These are all excellent, however, but the wise is my very nature, as I believe, for the wise, the constant intelligence, is in good condition in me as the best movement."
"7.19 At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vaasudeva (the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.","7.19. At the end of many births (in one particular birth) I receive the knowledge that 'this is all Vasudeva', a knowledgeable devotee; such a Mahatma is very rare."
"7.20 Those whose wisdom has been rent away by this or that desire, go to other gods, following this or that rite, led by their own nature.","7.20. Such men, driven by their own nature and by the desire for special enjoyment, who have been denied knowledge, prostrate themselves to other gods in observance of special rules."
7.21 Whatsoever form any devotee desires to worship with faith  that (same) faith of his I make firm and unflinching.,"7.21. Whosoever is a devotee, whosoever desires to worship the form of a deity with faith, I shall establish his faith in the same deity."
"7.22 Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that (form) and from it he obtains his desire, these being verily ordained by Me (alone).",He worships that deity with the devotion and receives from it the desired enjoyments which I have ordained.
"7.23 Verily the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me.",But the fruit of those little wise men is destructive. The gods of the gods come to the gods and my devotees come to me.
"7.24 The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My higher, immutable and most excellent nature.","The wise men do not know my supreme (best) supreme feeling, but regard me as manifest."
"7.25 I am not manifest to all (as I am) veiled by the Yoga-Maya. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable.","I am not visible to everyone in my Yoga. This enchanted people (mankind) does not know me as unborn, immortal."
"7.26 I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present and the future, but no one knows Me.","I know only the past and the present and the future, O Arjuna, but no man knows me."
"7.27 By the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Bharata, all beings are subject to delusion at birth, O Parantapa.",7. 27 - LRB - Heavenly India - RRB - Conflicts of will and hatred give rise to love only during the last evolutionary period.
"7.28 But those men of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, and who are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me, steadfast in their vows.","7.28. But the sins of the virtuous men who have been destroyed, those who are free from conflict and who are steadfast, exhort me."
"7.29 Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, realise in full ï1thatï1 Brahman, the whole knowledge of the Self and all action.","Those who, by joining me, try to get rid of the roots and death know the Brahman, the whole spirituality and the whole action."
"7.30 Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta (pertaining to the elements), Adhidaiva (pertaining to the gods) and the Adhiyajna (pertaining to the sacrifice) know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in mind.","7.30. The men who know me, including the supreme and the supernatural and the superconscious, know me even in the last days."
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"Arjuna said, 'O Purushaottam! What is Brahman, what is spirituality, and what is karma, and what is called the supernatural name, and what is called the supernatural name,"
"8.2 Who and how is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu (Krishna)? And how at the time of death, art Thou to be known by the self-controlled?","8. 2 And, honey, who is the Adjuster here? And how is he in this body? And how do you know at the end of the time by the men who are devoutly conscious?"
"8.3 The Blessed Lord said  Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; Its essential nature is called Self-knowledge; the offering (to the gods) which causes existence and manifestation of beings and which also sustains them is called action.","8. 3. Sri Bhagwan said - The supreme literal (inanimate) element is Brahman; the nature (its own nature) is called spirituality; the devil 's emotions generated by the devil' s devil (knowledge, motive force) is known as karma."
"8.4 Adhibhuta (knowledge of the elements) pertains to My perishable Nature and the Purusha or the Soul is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the embodied (men).","8. 4 Arjuna, the best of the dwellers of the earth, the deity is supreme and the man supreme; in this body I am the supreme."
"8.5 And whosoever, leaving the body, goes forth remembering Me alone, at the time of death, he attains My Being: there is no doubt about this.","And there is no doubt that whosoever leaves the body, remembering Me only in the end, receives My form."
"8.6 Whosoever at the end leaves the body, thinking of any being, to that being only does he go, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), because of his constant thought of that being.","In the end, whatever emotions the soul renounces in remembrance, it always receives as a result of the thought of that emotion."
"8.7 Therefore at all times remember Me only and fight. With mind and intellect fixed (or absorbed) in Me, thou shalt doubtessly come to Me alone.","Therefore, remember Me continually all the time, and fight, minded and wise, and you shall surely be given to Me."
"8.8 With the mind not moving towards any other thing, made steadfast by the method of habitual meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person, the Resplendent, O Arjuna.","8. 8, 8 - LRB - 'Heath' - RRB - The Yoga of Practice brings to the Supreme Divine Purusha the constant consciousness from the unknown consciousness."
"8.9 Whosoever meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler (of the whole world), minuter than an atom, the supporter of all, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun and beyond the darkness of ignorance.","Who remembers the Purusha, the all - knowing, the ancient (Puran), the initiator of all, even the subtlest of all, the thread of all, the form of consciousness, the form of light like the sun, and the element beyond darkness."
"8.10 At the time of death, with unshaken mind, endowed with devotio, by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole life-breath in the middle of the two eyrows, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person.","8.10. In the last time, he gets the supreme divine soul by placing the life in the midst of the womb with the Yoga force, devoting himself to the unshakable mind."
"8.11 That which is declared Imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the self-controlled (ascetics or Sannyasins) and passion-free enter, that desiring which celibacy is practised  that goal I will declare to thee in brief.","The scholars who know the Veda, who call themselves the 'letters', the lustless, diligent man who enters, who by his will follows the Brahmacharya - I will briefly tell you about that term."
"8.12 Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart and fixed the life-breath in the head, engaged in the practice of concentration.","8.1.2. In Yoga, all the doors of the senses were restrained, the mind fixed in the heart, and the life set in the head."
"8.13 Uttering the one-syllabled Om  the Brahman  and remembering Me, he who departs, leaving the body, attains to the Supreme Goal.",The man who pronounces this one letter Brahma and renounces the body in remembrance of me receives the supreme speed.
"8.14 I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me (for a long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single mind or one-pointed mind), O Partha (Arjuna).","I am readily available to the eternal yogi who remembers me, O Path!"
"8.15 Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth (here) which is the place of pain 
and is non-eternal: they have reached the highest perfection (liberation).",8.15. The Mahatma who receives the supreme perfection does not receive the rhythmic rebirth of unreal sorrow by receiving me.
"8.16 (All) the worlds including the world of Brahma are subject to return again, O Arjuna; but he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rirth.","8. 16. “O Arjuna, all people up to the Brahman world are reborn, but, oh my God, I will not be reborn when I am received. ”"
"8.17 Those people who know the day of Brahma which is of a duration of a thousand Yugas (ages) and the night which is also of a thousand Yugas duration, they know day and night.","Those who know the period of a day of Brahman, which is a thousand years, and a night of a thousand years, are men who know the day and the night."
8.18 From the Unmanifested all the manifested (worlds) proceed at the coming of the 'day'; at the coming of the 'night' they dissolve verily into ï1thatï1 alone which is called the Unmanifested.,"8.18. On the rise of the day (of Brahman), the manifest emerges from the invisible; and on the rise of the night (of Brahman) it is merged into the same invisible."
"8.19 This same multitude of beings, being born again and again, is dissolved, helplessly, O Arjuna (into the Unmanifested) at the coming of the night and comes forth at the coming of the day.",8.19. He is the ghost who reappears and reappears as a leon. Awash was (the ghost story) reveals the leon at the dawn of the night and the dawn of the day.
"8.20 But verily there exists, higher than this Unmanifested, another unmanifested Eternal, which is not destroyed when all beings are destroyed.","But beyond the unexpressed, the other eternal unexpressed emotion does not perish even when all beings perish."
"8.21 What is called the Unmanifested and the Imperishable, That they say is the highest goal. They who reach It do not return (to this Samsara). That is My highest abode (place or state).","What is called the unexpressed letter is the supreme momentum, which, when it is received, does not return, it is my supreme home."
"8.22 That highest Purusha, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Him alone within Whom all beings dwell and by Whom all this is pervaded.","8.22. O Path! The Supreme Being, within whom are all the devils and from whom this wholeness is encompassed, can be obtained only by exclusive devotion."
"8.23 Now I will tell thee, O chief of Bharatas, the times departing at which the Yogis will return or not return.","I will tell you, O Bharatshreshtha, the time when the yogis who have abandoned their bodies receive rebirth and (or) rebirth."
"8.24 Fire, light daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern path of the sun (the northern solstice)  departing then (by these) men who know Brahman go to Brahman.","The Brahman saints who, after their death, go through the six - month path of fire, light, day, moon and sunset, get to Brahman."
"8.25 Attaining to the lunar light by smoke, night time, the dark fortnight also, the six months of the southern path of the sun (the southern solstice), the Yogi returns.","8.25. The yogi returns to the moon by receiving the light of the moon through the six - month path of the comet, night, the moon side and the southern moon."
8.26 The bright and the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal; by the one (the bright path) a man goes not to return and by the other (the dark path) he returns.,These two kinds of Shukla and Krishna paths of the world are considered to be eternal. One of them (Shukla) brings about (the lasting) rebirth and the other (Krishna) brings about a rebirth.
"8.27 Knowing these paths, O Arjuna, no Yogi is deluded; therefore at all times be steadfast in Yoga.","No Yogi who knows these two paths is enchanted. Therefore, Arjuna, become Yogic in time."
"8.28 Whatever fruit of merit is declared (in the scriptures) to accrue from (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) sacrifices, (the practice of) austerities, and gifts  beyond all this goes the Yogi, having known this; and he attains to the Supreme Primeval (first or ancient) Abode.","The yogi man, knowing all this (the principles of the two ways), goes beyond what is called the virtuous fruit of teaching, sacrifice, penance and charity, and attains the highest place."
"9.1 The Blessed Lord said  I shall now declare to thee who does not cavil, the greatest secret, the knowledge combined with experience (Self-realisation). Having known this thou shalt be free evil.","9. 1. Sri Bhagwan said - For you who are blind, I will say this supreme knowledge with science, which you will be freed from evil."
"9.2 This is the kingl science, the kingly secret, the supreme purifier, realisable by direct intuitional knowledge, according to righteousness, very easy to perform and imperishable.","This knowledge is Rajivya (the king of the sciences) and Rajguha (the king of all the ghosts, i. e. the mystics) and is holy, good, direct, knowledgeable and religious, and easy to do and inexpensive."
"9.3 Those who have no faith in this Dharma (knowledge of the Self), O Parantapa (Arjuna), return to the path of this world of death without attaining Me.","9. 3. In this religion, the faithless men live in the world of death, not receiving me."
"9.4 All this world is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest aspect; all beings exist in Me, but I do not dwell in them.","This whole world is encompassed by the invisible nature of me (the spirit); all the devils are in me, but I am not in them."
"9.5 Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality); behold My divine Yoga, supporting all beings, but not dwelling in them, is My Self, the efficient cause of beings.",And not only is the devil in me; see my divine Yoga that my soul which holds the devils and produces the devils is not in those devils.
"9.6 As the mighty wind, moving everywhere, rests always in the ether, even so, know thou that all beings rest in Me.","As the great air that circulates all over is always in the sky, so is the whole world in me, as you know."
"9.7 All beings, O Arjuna, go into My Nature at the end of a Kalpa; I send them forth again at the beginning of (the next) Kalpa.",9. 7. O God! At the end of the dream all the ghosts come to My nature; and at the beginning of the dream I create them again.
"9.8 Animating My Nature, I again and again send forth all this multitude of beings, helpless by the force of the Nature.","9. 8. I re - create this whole devil community, subdued by nature (i. e. by giving it consciousness), subdued by nature."
"9.9 These acts do not bind Me, O Arjuna, sitting like one indifferent, unattached to those acts.",They do not bind me - LRB - the soul - RRB - who is indifferent and depressed in these works.
"9.10 Under Me as supervisor, Nature produces the moving and the unmoving; because of this, O Arjuna, the world revolves.","9. 10. < s > Because of my Chairman (i. e. under my Chairmanship), Nature creates a world of creatures; hence the world revolves."
"9.11 Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great Lord of (all) beings.","The great God form of all the devils does not know my supreme feeling and the foolish people, the human beings, disrespect my God."
"9.12 Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge and senseless, they verily are possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings.","9. 12. The unthinking people of old hope, old work and old knowledge possess the charming nature of the demons and the devils."
"9.13 But the great souls, O Arjuna, partaking of My divine nature, worship Me with a single mind (with the mind devoted to nothing else), knowing Me as the imperishable source of beings.","But the Mahatma, who is dependent on the divine nature, glorifies me, knowing all the devils as primitive and inexhaustible, full of unity."
"9.14 Always glorifying Me, striving,firm in vows, prostrating themselves before Me, they worship Me with devotion always steadfast.","9.14. The hardworking, hardworking men greet me constantly, worship me devoutly and eternally."
"9.15 Others also sacrificing with the wisdom-sacrifice worship Me, the All-faced, as one, as distinct, and as manifold.","Some worship me in a united way by worshipping me with knowledge, some worship me in a separate way, some worship me in many ways in a universal form."
9.16 I am the Kratu; I am the Yajna; I am the offering (food) to the manes; I am the medicinal herbs and all the plants; I am the Mantra; I am also the Ghee or the melted butter; I am the fire; I am the oblation.,"9. 16. I am Krishna; I am Yajna; I am Sudha and Medicine; I am Mantra, I am Ghai, I am Agni and I am Hutan, or the Hawan Karma."
"9.17 I am the father of this world, the mother, the dispenser of the fruits of actions and the 
grandfather; the (one) thing to be known, the purifier, the sacred monosyllable (Om), and also the Rik-, the Sama-and the Yajur-Vedas.","9. 17. I am the father, mother, father - in - law and father - in - law of this world. I am the instrument, the holy, the ovar, the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda and the Yajur Veda."
"9.18 I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the shelter, the friend, the origin, the dissolution, the foundation, the treasure-house and the seed which is imperishable.","9.18. I am also the mover, the bearer of burdens, the Lord, the witness, the dweller, the shelter and the friend, and the source, the cause of death and the place of repose, and the cause of loss."
"9.19 (As the sun) I give heat; I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also death, existence and non-existence, O Arjuna.","9. 19. < s > O Arjuna, I am the Hearer, I am the Disposer and the Producer of the rain. I am the nectar, the death, the being and the spirit."
"9.20 The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, purified of all sins, worshipping Me by sacrifices, pray for the way to heaven; they reach the holy world of the Lord of the gods and enjoy in heavn the divine pleasures of the gods.","9.20. The saints of the three Vedas (the practitioners of the aforementioned sacraments), the people who drink and are purified from sins desire to receive heaven by worshipping me through sacrifices; they receive the rainbow as the fruit of their virtues and enjoy the divine gods in heaven."
"9.21 They, having enjoyed the vast heaven, enter the world of mortals when their merit is exhausted; thus abiding by the injunctions of the ï1threeï1 (Vedas) and desiring (objects of) desires, they attain to the state of going and returning.","By experiencing that vast heavenly world, when they are deprived of virtue, they arrive at the world of death. Thus, the males who are sheltered by the action mentioned in the three Vedas and who desire to enjoy it, arrive at the gateway."
"9.22 For those men who worship Me alone, thinking of no other, for those ever-united, I secure what is not already possessed and preserve what they already possess.","In my unique thought, I join the eternal men whom the devotees worship with me."
"9.23 Even those devotees who, endowed with faith, worship other gods, worship Me alone, O Arjuna, b the wrong method.",The devotees who worship other gods with devotion also worship Me inviolably.
"9.24 (For) I alone am the enjoyer and also the Lord of all sacrifices; but they do not know Me in essence (in reality), and hence they fall (return to this mortal world).","Since I am the feeder and master of all sacrifices, but they do not know me in principle, they fall, that is to say, they reach the world."
9.25 The worshippers of the gods go to them; to the manes go the ancestor-worshippers; to the deities who preside over the elements go their worshippers; but My devotees come to Me.,"9.25. The worshippers of the gods come to the gods, the father worshippers come to the fathers, the devils who inhabit the devils come to the devils, and the devotees who worship me come to me."
"9.26 Whoever offers Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a little water  that, so offered devotedly by the pure-minded, I accept.","9.26.

"9.27 Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest in sacrifice, whatever thou givest, whatever thou practisest as austerity, O Arjuna, do it as an offering unto Me.","Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you burn, whatever you give, whatever you meditate on, all these things give to me."
"9.28 Thus shalt thou be freed from the bonds of actions yielding good and evil fruits; with the mind steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and liberated, thou shalt come unto Me.","In this way you will be freed from the bonds of karma as a result of good and evil; and you will be freed from Me, having become conscious of the Sanyasi Yoga."
9.29 The same am I to all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear; but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me and I am also in them.,I am equal to all the devils; none hates me or loves me; but those who worship me are within me and I am among them.
"9.30 Even if the most sinful worships Me, with devotion to none else, he too should indeed by regarded as righteous for he has rightly resolved.","9. 30. If even the most ruthless man devotes himself to me as a devotee, he is only worthy of being regarded as a saint, for he is truthful and determined."
"9.31 Soon he becomes righteous and attains to eternal peace; O Arjuna, proclaim thou for certain that My devotee never perishes.",He soon becomes a religious soul and receives eternal peace. You certainly know the truth that my devotee never perishes.
"9.32 For, taking refuge in Me, they also who, O Arjuna, may be of a sinful birth  women, Vaisyas as well as Sudras  attain the Supreme Goal.","9.32. O pilgrims, women, Vaishyas and Shudras, whoever is a sinner, they too have recourse to Me and come to the supreme speed."
"9.33 How much more (easily) then the hold Brahmins and devoted royal saints (attain the goal); having come to this impermanent and unhappy world, do thou worship Me.","9. 33. What is it to say, then, that the virtuous Brahmins and the Rajrshi devotees (have reached the supreme speed); (so) by reaching this uncertain and unhappy people (now) worship Me with devotion."
"9.34 Fix thy mind on Me; by devoted to Me; sacrifice unto Me; bow down to Me; having thus united thy whole self to Me, taking Me as the supreme goal, thou shalt come unto Me.","Be steadfast in me; be devotees and worshippers of me; greet me; thus you will come to me, having taken the Spirit from me, as I am the ultimate goal."

"11.7 Now behold, O Arjuna, in this, My body, the whole universe centred in one  including the moving and the unmoving  and whatever else thou desirest to see.","Today (now) see the whole world, including the birds in one place in my body, and see what else you want to see."
11.8 But thou art not able to behold Me with these thine own eyes; I give thee the divine eye; behold My lordly Yoga.,But you are not able to see me through these eyes of yours; therefore I give you a divine vision from which you can see my divine Yoga.
"11.9 Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken, O king, the great Lord of Yoga, hari (Krishna), showed to Arjuna His supreme form as the Lord.","Sanjay said, ""Hey Rajan, Mahayogaeshwar Hari once again showed Arjun the most divine form."
"11.10 With numerous mouths and eyes, with numerous wonderful sights, with numerous divine ornaments, with numerous divine weapons uplifted (such a form He showed).",11.10. He had many faces and eyes and many wonderful visions and many divine jewels and many divine weapons in his hands.
"11.11 Wearing divine garlands (necklaces) and apparel, anointed with divine unguents, the all-wonderful, resplendent (Being) endless with faces on all sides.","In divine robes and garments and with divine scent, with all kinds of wonders, the infinite, the universal, the supreme God - LRB - whom Arjun saw - RRB -."
"11.12 If the splendour of a thousand suns were to blaze out at once (simultaneously) in the sky, that would be the splendour of that mighty Being (great Soul).",11. 12. The light that arises from the rise of a thousand suns together in the sky will be like the light of that (universal) God.
"11.13 There, in the body of the God of gods, Arjuna then saw the whole universe resting in one, with its many groups.","11. 13 - Panduputra Arjun saw the whole world divided in various ways at that time in one place in the body of Lord Krishna, the god of the gods."
"11.14 Then, Arjuna, filled with wonder and with his hair standing on end, bowed down his head to the God and spoke with joined palms.","Afterwards, he was astonished to see the joyful Romans (who are experiencing a sensation) praising Dhanjay Arjuna Visvarupa Deva (with his devotion to the warrior) with his head joined by his hands."
"11.15 Arjuna said  I see all the gods, O God, in Thy body, and (also) hosts of various classes of beings, Brahma, the Lord, seated on the lotus, all the sages and the celestial serpents.","Arjuna said, ""My God, I see all the gods in your body and the communities of many special beings, and the Lord of the universe, Brahman, the sages and the divine serpents, who are on the throne."
"11.16 I see Thee of boundless form on every side with many arms, stomachs, mouths and eyes: neither the end nor the middle nor also the beginning do I see, O Lord of the universe, O Cosmic Form.","I see you as multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted, multifaceted."
"11.17 I see Thee with the diadem, the club and the discus, a mass of radiance shining

I see from all sides your crowned, crowned, cyclical, and from all sides luminous, bright, luminous, like the burning fire and the sun, a luminous, exceedingly difficult and immeasurable flame."
"11.18 Thou art the Imperishable, the Supreme Being, worthy to be known. Thou art the great treasure-house of this universe; Thou art the imperishable protector of the eternal Dhrama; Thou art the Primal Person, I deem.","You are the Supreme Character; You are the supreme shelter of the world! You are the guardian of the eternal religion and you are the eternal soul, I believe."
"11.19 I see Thee without beginning, middle or end, infinite in power, of endless arms, the sun and the moon being Thy eyes, the burning fire Thy mouth, heating the whole universe with Thy radiance.","11.19. I see you beginning, endless and infinite, with infinite serenity, with infinite hands, with eyes like the moon and with a mouth like a flaming fire, and with my own light, spreading out this world."
"11.20 This space between the earth and the heaven and all the arters are filled by Thee alone; having seen this, Thy wonderful and teriible form, the three worlds are trembling with fear, O great-souled Being.","The heavens and all directions between heaven and earth are inhabited by you alone, O Mahatma; the three peoples are being overwhelmed by your wonderful and violent form."
"11.21 Verily, into Thee enter these hosts of gods; some extol Thee in fear with joined palms; saying 'may it be well', bands of great sages and perfected ones praise Thee with hymns complete.","These groups of all the gods are entering you, and many of them join hands in fear, praising you; the community of the Maharshi and the Siddhas praising you by the best (or all) sources, saying, 'Be blessed.'"
"11.22 The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Visvedevas, the two Asvins, Maruts, the manes and the hosts of celestial singers, Yakshas, demons and the perfected ones, are all looking at Thee, in great amazement.","11.22. Rudraganas, Aditya, Vasu and Siddhaganas, Visvedev and two Ashwinikumars, Marudganas and Ushmpas, Gandharva, Yaksha, Asura and Siddhaganas - these are all the communities of wonder you see."
"11.23 Having seen Thy immeasurable form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed, with many arms, thighs and feet, with many stomachs and fearful with many teeth  the worlds are terrified and so am I.","11. 23. < s > O Mahabharaoh! Everyone is upset to see your great figure with many mouths and eyes, many ears, ears and feet, many ears and many crooked teeth, and so am I."
"11.24 On seeing Thee (the Cosmic Form) touching the sky, shining in many colours, with mouths wide open, with large fiery eyes, I am terrified at heart and find neither courage nor peace, O Vishnu.",I am terrified to see you touching the heavens in many luminous forms and having a flat face and luminous large eyes. I am not getting patience and peace.
"11.25 Having seen Thy mouths fearful with teeth (blazing) like the fires of cosmic dissolution, I know not the four arters, nor do I find peace. Have mercy, O Lord of the gods, O abode of the universe.","11. 25 - I cannot see the directions, nor can I find peace, when I see your flaming faces, like those of a fiery old man and a flaming fire; therefore, O Devas, O Jagannais, rejoice."
"11.26 All the sons of Dhritarashtra, with the hosts of kings of the earth, Bhishma, Drona and Karna, with the chief among our warriors.","And they enter you with the whole community of the sons of Dhritarashtra, the kings, Bhishma, Drona and Karna, and the chief warriors of our side."
"11.27 Some hurriedly enter Thy mouths with their terrible teeth, fearful to behold. Some are found sticking in the gaps between the teeth with their heads crushed to powder.","11. 27. < s > At high speed, your scalpels enter the horrific mouths of your teeth, and many of them appear to be stuck between your teeth, with one crushed head."
"11.28 Verily, just as many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, even so these heroes in the world of men enter Thy flaming mouths.","As many rivers flow to the sea at speed, so these brave warriors of the world of man enter your burning mouths."
"11.29 As moths hurriedly rush into a blazing fire for (their own) destruction, so also these creatures hurriedly rush into Thy mouths for (their own) destruction.","As flies enter the flaming fire for their destruction, so do they enter your mouths for their destruction."
"11.30 Thou lickest up, devouring all the worlds on every side with Thy flaming mouths. Thy fierce rays, filling the whole world with radiance, are burning, O Vishnu!","11. 30. You, Vishnu, greet all these peoples with your burning mouths, your fierce light filling the whole world with light."
"11.31 Tell me, who Thou art, so fierce of form. Salutations to Thee, O God Supreme: have mercy. I desire to know Thee, the original Being. I know not indeed Thy working.","11. 31. (Please) Say to me, Who are you of the extreme nature? Best of Gods! Greet you, please be happy. I want to know you of the extreme nature, because I do not understand your tendency (i. e. purpose)."
"11.32 The Blessed Lord said  I am the full-grown world-destroying Time, now engaged in destroying the worlds. Even without thee, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile armies shall live.",Shri Bhagwan said - I am in the age of destruction of peoples. I am in the age of destruction of these peoples. Those who are warriors in the army of opponents will not live without you.
"11.33 Therefore, stand up and obtain fame. Coner the enemies and enjoy the unrivalled kingdom. Verily by Me have they been already slain; be thou a mere instrument, O Arjuna.","Therefore, rise up and be victorious; conquer your enemies and enjoy a rich kingdom. All these have already been killed by me. O Savisachin, be thou only a helper."

"11.35 Sanjaya said  Having heard that speech of Lord Krishna, Arjuna, with joined palms, trembling, prostrating himself, again addressed Krishna, in a choked voice, bowing down, overwhelmed with fear.","Sanjay said - Hearing this word of the Lord Keshav, Arjun the crown - bearer joined his hands, shook his hands, greeted him, and again feared and said to Srikrishna a lying word."
"11.36 Arjuna said  It is meet, O Krishna, that the world delights and rejoices in Thy praise; demons fly in fear to all arters and the hosts of the perfected ones bow to Thee.",Arjuna said - It is worthy of your kirtana that the world rejoices greatly and receives affection. Fearful demons run in all directions and the community of all the theologians greet you.
"11.37 And why should they not, O great Soul, bow to Thee Who art greater (than all else), the primal cause even of the Creator (Brahma), O Infinite Being, O Lord of the gods, O Abode of the universe; Thou art the imperishable, the Being, the non-being and That which is the supreme (that which is beyond the Being and the non-being).","How can they not greet you, O Mahatma, the first and the best of the creators of Brahman? (For) O Infinite, O Devas, O Jagannavas, who is the Reality and the Literacy beyond these two, is You."
"11.38 Thou art the primal God, the ancient Purusha, the supreme refuge of this universe, the knower, the knowable and the supreme Abode. By Thee is the universe pervaded, O Being of infinite forms.","You are the Adidev and Purana (Satan) Man. You are the supreme shelter, the Knower, the Knower, the (knowable) and the Supreme Being of this world. You alone are the eternal embodiment of this world."
"11.39 Thou art Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the moon, the Creator, and the great-grandfather. Salutations, salutations unto Thee, a thousand times, and again salutations, salutations unto Thee.","You are the air, the heavens, the fire, the sun, the moon, the goddess (Bharama) and the father - in - law (because of the Brahman); to you greetings a thousand times, greetings again, greetings again."
"11.40 Salutations to Thee, in front and behind! Salutations to Thee on every side! O All!! Thou infinite in power and prowess, pervadest all; wherefore Thou art all.","11. 40. “O God of infinite mercy! Greetings to you from the front and the back, O Almighty! Greetings to you from all sides. You are immensely brave and have encompassed you all, and from this you are all. ”"
"11.41 Whatever I have presumptuously said from carelessness or love, addressing Thee as O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend! regarding Thee merely as a friend, unknowing of this, Thy greatness.","11. 41. Dear God, not knowing this glory of yours as a Sakha, and not knowing this glory of yours as a Sakha, I have spoken to you with praise or love, ""O Krishna, O Yadav, O Sakha!"""
"11.42 In whatever way I may have insulted Thee for the sake of fun, while at play, reposing, sitting or at meals, when alone (with Thee), O Krishna, or in company  that I implore Thee, immeasurable one, to forgive.","And, O Achyut, whom you have been humiliated by me in Bihar, in bed, sitting and eating alone or even in the presence of others for laughter, I condemn you in an unforgivable manner."
"11.43 Thou art the Father of this world, moving and unmoving. Thou art to be adored by this world, Thou, the greatest Guru; (for) none there exists who is eal to Thee; how then could there be another superior to Thee in the three worlds, O Being of unealled power?","You are the father, the most revered and the best guru of this world. O God of eternal influence! There is none like you in all three worlds, so how could it be better than you?"
"11.44 Therefore, bowing down, prostrating my body, I crave Thy forgiveness, O adorable Lord. As a father forgives his son, a friend his (dear) friend, a lover his beloved, even so shouldst Thou 
forgive me, O God.","Therefore, O God, I pray that you, worthy of praise, may rejoice in the presence of God through the body. O God, forgive my sins just as the Father forgives the Son, the Friend forgives the Friend, and the Beloved forgives the Father."
"11.45 I am delighted, having seen what has never been seen before; and yet my mind is distressed with fear. Show me that (previous) form only, O God; have mercy, O God of gods, O Abode of the universe.","11. 45. I am delighted to see you in this unprecedented form, and my mind is overwhelmed with fear. Therefore, O God, show me the same epoch. O Devas, O Jagannais, please."
"11.46 I desire to see Thee as before, crowned, bearing a mace, with the discus in hand, in Thy former form only, having four arms, O thousand-armed, Cosmic Form (Being).","I would like to see you, likewise, with crowns, shields and wheels in your hands. < s > O Visvaमूर्तe! O Thousand Years! Be of that quadrilateral shape."
"11.47 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, this Cosmic Form has graciously been shown to thee by Me by My own Yogic power; full of splendour, primeval, and infinite, this Cosmic Form of Mine has never been seen before by anyone other than thyself.","11. 47. I am glad to see you, Arjuna, that through the power of my Yoga I have shown you this supreme, all and infinite universe which no one has seen before you."
"11.48 Neither by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, nor by gifts nor by rituals nor by severe austerities can I be seen in this form in the world of men by any other than thyself, O great hero of the Kurus (Arjuna).","I cannot be seen in this form by anyone else in this human world except you, O Kuruphira, neither by meditation, nor by sacrifice, nor by charity, nor by (religious) acts, nor by violent penances."
"11.49 Be not afraid, nor bewildered on seeing such a teriible form of Mine as this; with thy fear dispelled and with a gladdened heart, now behold again this former form of Mine.","Thus, you will not be despondent and foolish when you see me in this grave form. Be fearless and rejoice and see me again in the same form."
"11.50 Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Krishna again showed His own form and the great Soul (Krishna), assuming His gentle form, consoled him (Arjuna) who was terrified.","Sanjay said - Lord Vasudeva once again showed his (former) form to Arjuna, and then, the gentle form of Mahatma Krishna assured this fearful Arjuna."
"11.51 Arjuna said  Having seen this Thy gentle human form, O Krishna, now I am composed and am restored to my own nature.","Arjun said, ""Dear Janaran, I have come to my own nature, calmed by your gentle human form."
11.52 The Blessed Lord said  Very hard indeed it is to see this form of Mine which thou hast seen. Even the gods are ever longing to behold it.,Shri Bhagwan said - It is very rare for me to see this form which you have seen. The gods too are always eager to see this form.
"11.53 Neither by the Vedas nor by austerity, nor by gift, nor by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as thou hast seen Me (so easily).","I can be seen as you have seen me, neither by the Vedas, nor by the penance, nor by the gift, nor by the sacrifice."
"11.54 But by single-minded devotion can I, of this Form, be known and seen in reality and also entered into, O Arjuna.","But, O supreme Arjuna, by exclusive devotion I am, in principle, able to 'know', 'see' and 'enter' (to be received in one spirit)."
"11.55 He who does all actions for Me, who looks upon Me as the Supreme, who is devoted to Me, who is free from attachment, who bears enmity towards no creature, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.","He who works for me, He who regards me as the ultimate goal, He who is my devotee, He who is devout, He who is devout to the devil, He who is devout to the only devil, He comes to me."
"12.1 Arjuna said  Those devotees who, ever steadfast, thus worship Thee and those also who worship the imperishable and the unmanifested  which of them are better versed in Yoga?",Arjuna said - Who is the best yogi among the devotees who worship you in this manner (as aforesaid) constantly and who worship the literal and the impersonal?
"12.2 The Blessed Lord said  Those who, fixing their mind on Me, worship Me, ever steadfast and endowed with supreme faith, are the best in Yoga in My opinion.","Shri Bhagwan said - The devotees who worship me with the utmost devotion are, in my opinion, the best, that is to say, the best."

"12.4 Having restrained all the senses, even-minded everywhere, intent on the welfare of all beings  verily they also come unto Me.",12. 4 I am the one who receives the devotees who regularly regulate the sense community in the interests of all beings who are equal everywhere.
"12.5 Greater is their trouble whose minds are set on the unmanifested; for the goal; the unmanifested, is very hard for the embodied to reach.",12. 5 But the men with the psyche attached to the impersonal are more troubled because the movement of the impersonal is difficult to obtain from the bodyguards. 12. 5
"12.6 But to those who worship Me, renouncing all actions in Me, regarding Me as the supreme gaol, meditating on Me with single-minded Yoga.","But those devotees who consider me to be the ultimate goal, devote all their works to me, and pay attention to me by exclusive action."
"12.7 To those whose minds are set on Me, O Arjuna, verily I become ere long the saviour out of the ocean of Samsara.","12. 7. I am about to rescue the devotees of the dead from the sea of the world, O pilgrims, whose spirit is fixed in me."
"12.8 Fix thy mind in Me only, thy intellect in Me, (then) thou shalt no doubt live in Me alone hereafter.","Fix your mind and your intelligence in me, and you shall dwell in me, there is no doubt about it."
"12.9 If thou art unable to fix thy mind steadily on Me, then by the Yoga of constant practice do thou seek to reach Me, O Arjuna.","12. 9. < s > If you are not able to stabilise your mind in me, wish to attain me by practicing Yoga."
"12.10 If thou art unable to practise even this Abhyasa Yoga, be thou intent on doing actions for My sake; even by doing actions for My sake, thou shalt attain perfection.","12. 10. If you are unable to practise, be a practitioner of miracles; in this way you will attain perfection even though you do things for me."
"12.11 If thou art unable to do even this, then, resorting to union with Me, renounce the fruits of all actions with the self controlled.","And if you are unable to do this, then with self - restraint and with the help of Yoga, abandon the fruit of all your deeds."
12.12 Better indeed is knowledge than practice; than knowledge meditation is better; than meditation the renunciation of the fruits of actions: peace immediately follows renunciation.,"12. 12. Knowledge is better than practice; meditation is better than knowledge, and even meditation is better than work. renunciation is renunciation."
"12.13 He who hates no creature, who is friendly and compassionate to all, who is free from attachment and egoism, balanced in pleasure and pain, and forgiving.","12. 13. 2. He who is without envy to the past and friend and compassionate to all; who is free of affection and egoism, equal in happiness and evil and forgiving."
"12.14 Ever content, steady in meditation, self-controlled, possessed of firm conviction, with the mind and intellect dedicated to Me, he, My devtoee, is dear to Me.","12. 14. I love the restrained soul, the determined yogi who is always satisfied, who has devoted his mind and his intellect to me, who is my devotee."
"12.15 He by whom the world is not agitated and who cannot be agitated by the world, and who is freed from joy, anger, fear and anxiety  he is dear to Me.","12. 15. I love the devotee who does not get the enthusiasm of a people (i. e. a person) and who does not even feel the enthusiasm of a person himself and who is free from joy, bitterness (intolerance), fear and enthusiasm."
"12.16 He who is free from wants, pure, expert, unconcerned, and free from pain, renouncing all undertakings or commencements  he who is (thus) devoted to Me, is dear to Me.","12. 16. I love my devotee who is unparalleled, pure, skilled, indifferent, free and devout to all works."
"12.17 He who neither rejoices, nor hates, nor grieves, nor desires, renouncing good and evil, and who is full of devotion, is dear to Me.",12. 17. I love the devout man who neither rejoices nor hates; neither mourns nor longs; and who forsakes good and evil.
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,Swami Tejomayananda
"12.19 He to whom censure and praise are eal, who is silent, content with anything, homeless, of a steady mind, and full of devotion  that man is dear to Me.","12. 19. I love the devout man of static intellect, who is equal to both reproach and praise, who is silent, who is satisfied with nothing but a small thing, who is indefatigable."
"12.20 They verily who follow this immortal Dharma (law or doctrine) as described above, endowed with faith, regarding Me as their supreme goal, they, the devotees, are exceedingly dear to Me.","I am very fond of those devotees who are devout and who think of me as the ultimate goal and follow this sacred nectar, the sacred life."
"13.1 Arjuna said  I wish to learn about Nature (matter) and the Spirit (soul), the field and the knower of the field, knowledge and that which ought to be known, O Kesava.","Arjun said, ""Hey Keshav, I want to know nature and man, the field and the field, and knowledge and knowledge."
"13.2 The Blessed Lord said  This body, O Arjuna, is called the field; he who knows it is called the knower of the field, by those who know of them.","Sri Bhagwan said, ""Hey, whoa! This body is called the field and he who knows it is called the elemental man, the fielder."
"13.3 Do thou also know Me as the knower of the field in all fields, O Arjuna. Knowledge of both the field and the knower of the field is considered by Me to be ï1the ï1 knowledge.",I believe that the knowledge of the field and the knowledge of the field are the same.
"13.4 What the field is and of what nature, what are its modifications and whence it is and also who He is and what His powers are  hear all that from Me in brief.","Therefore, listen to me briefly about what is and what is like and what has diseases, and what has happened because of what, and what is and what has influence."
"13.5 Sages have sung in many ways, in various distinctive chants and also in the suggestive words indicative of the Absolute, full of reasoning and decisive.","13. 5 - LRB - in the matter of field - field - scholar - RRB -, various and varied verses have been sung by the sages, and by the appropriately defined words of the rational Brahmo Sutra (i. e. the indicative words of Brahmo) - RRB -."
"13.6 The great elements, egoism, intellect, and also the Unmanifested Nature, the ten senses and one (mind), and the five objects of the senses.","12. 6. 12. Pancha Mahabhuta, ego, intellect, invisible (nature), ten senses, one mind, five subjects of senses."
"13.7 Desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the aggregate (the body), intelligence, fortitude  the field has thus been briefly described with its modifications.","1.37. 32. Desire, hatred, happiness, sorrow, union (substantial doubt), consciousness (mindfulness of infinity) and tenacity - thus this area is briefly described including disorders."
"13.8 Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forgiveness, uprightness, service of the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control.","1.38. 32. Amnesia, Immediacy, Nonviolence, Forgiveness, Advancing, Service to the Acharya, Purity, Stability and Self - Control."

"13.10 Non-attachment, non-identification of the Self with son, wife, home and the rest, and constant even-mindedness on the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable.","13.10. Innocence in affection and son, wife, home, etc. (lack of identity); and equality in the attainment of the good and the evil."
"13.11 Unswerving devotion unto Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to solitary places, distaste for the society of men.",13. 11. 12. I am devoted to non - prostitution through solitary confinement and dislike of the community of (unsanskrit) people.
"13.12 Constancy in Self-knowledge, perception of the end of true knowledge  this is declared to be knowledge, and what is opposed to it is ignorance.","13. 12. In spiritualism, eternity, that is, stability, and the meaning of the doctrine of the philosophy of the Divine, are all called knowledge, and the opposite is ignorance."
"13.13 I will declare that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to immortality, the beginningless supreme Brahman, called neither being nor non-being.","I would like to make it clear that the thing which is known, which man knows, is the immortality. It is known - the infinite, the supreme Brahman, which cannot be said to be neither being nor being."
"13.14 With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, He exists in the worlds enveloping all.","13. 14. He is all - handed, all - eyed, all - headed, all - faced, all - hearing; he is all - encompassing in the world."
"13.15 Shining by the functions of all the senses, yet without the senses; unattached, yet supporting all; devoid of alities, yet their experiencer.","13.15. He is manifested by the attributes of all the senses, but is without all the senses; devoid of attachment and devoid of attributes, yet caring for all and a devotee of attributes."
"13.16 Without and within (all) beings the unmoving and also the moving; because of Its subtlety, unknowable; and near and far away is That.",13.16. (He is the Brahman) is invisible to the ghost alone; it is variable and unchanging; it is invisible by its tinyness; it is distant and very close.
"13.17 And undivided, yet It exists as if divided in beings; It is to be known as the supporter of being; It devours and It generates.","And he is undivided, yet he is as divided as the devils. He is the creator, destroyer and originator of all the devils, the Knowing Brahman."
"13.18 That, the Light of all lights, is said to be beyond darkness: knowledge, the knowable and the goal of knowledge, seated in the hearts of all.",13.18. (The Brahman) is also called the light of lights and beyond darkness. He is knowledgeable and knowable by knowledge. He is in the hearts of all.
"13.19 Thus the field, as well as knowledge and the knowable have been briefly stated. My devotee, knowing this, enters into My Being.","13.19. Thus, the field, knowledge and knowledge were summed up (by me). Knowing it from the substance (knowledge) my devotee receives my nature."
13.20 Know thou that Nature (matter) and the Spirit are both beginningless; and know also that all modifications and alities are born of Nature.,"You know both nature and man, and you know that all diseases and qualities come from nature."
"13.21 In the production of the effect and the cause, Nature (matter) is said to be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the cause.","13.21. Nature is said to produce work and cause, and man is said to be the father of happiness and suffering."
13.22 The soul seated in Nature experiences the alities born of Nature; attachment to the alities is the cause of its birth in good and evil wombs.,13. 22. 22. The male in nature enjoys the qualities of nature. The combination of these qualities is the reason for this male (life) to be born in the good and evil wives.
"13.23 The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord and the Supreme Self.","It is the supreme being who is called in this body the supervisor, the emperor, the guardian, the eater, the god and the divine."
"13.24 He who thus knows the Spirit and Matter together with the alities, in whatever condition he may be, he is not born again.","Thus, man who knows nature, including the man and the qualities, does not rebirth by living (behaving) in all ways."
"13.25 Some by meditation behold the Self in the self by the self, others by the Yoga of knowledge, and still others by the Yoga of action.",13.25. Some men see the soul in the soul (heart) through the soul (pure intellect) through the practice of meditation; others through the Sanshya Yoga and some sages through the Karma Yoga (the soul).
"13.26 Others also, not knowing thus, worship, having heard of It from others; they, too, cross beyond death, regarding what they have heard as the Supreme refuge.","But those who worship, not knowing it, but by listening to others - LRB - the Acharyas - RRB -, the Shrutiprayans - LRB - those for whom there is a supreme means of hearing - RRB - also surely go to death."
"13.27 Wherever a being is born, whether unmoving or moving, know thou, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), that it is from the union between the field and its knower.","13. 27 - LRB - Bharat Shrestha - RRB -, whatever static tangible objects are created, you must know that they are created by the combination of the field and the expert."
"13.28 He sees, who sees the Supreme Lord, existing eally in all beings, the unperishing within the perishing.",13. 28 The one who sees the God who is invisible in all the devils is the one who sees (in fact) the God who is invisible.
13.29 Because he who sees the same Lord eally dwelling everywhere does not destroy the Self by the self; he goes to the highest goal.,"13.29. Surely, the soul does not destroy the soul (self) by a soul (self) equal to God everywhere in the same sense, thus it obtains the supreme motion."
"13.30 He sees, who sees that all actions are performed by Nature alone and that the Self is actionless.",13. 30. Whoever sees all the works done by Nature and sees the Self as the Actor sees Him (in fact).
"13.31 When a man sees the whole variety of beings as resting in the One, and spreading forth from That alone, he then becomes Brahman.","13.31. When the soul sees the separate emotions of the devils in one (the Spirit) and knows that it is from him (the Spirit) that this expansion has taken place, it comes to Brahman."
"13.32 Being without beginning and being devoid of (any) alities, the Supreme Self, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted.","13. 32. “He who is invisible and unqualified is the God. Even though he is in the body, he does not act, nor is he bound. ”"
"13.33 As the all-pervading ether is not tainted, because of its subtlety, so the Self seated everywhere in the body is not tainted.","13.33. Just as the universe is not bound by the tinyness of the heavens, so the soul in the body is not bound everywhere."
"13.34 Just as the one sun illumines the whole world, so also the Lord of the field (Supreme Self) 
illumines the whole field, O Arjuna.","13. 34 O India! Just as the same sun shines upon this whole people, so shines upon the whole region the same field."
"13.35 They who, by the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the field and its knower and also the liberation from the Nature of being, go to the Supreme.","Thus, those who know the distinction between the field and the fielder and the liberation from the defects of nature by the Yoga of Knowledge come to the Supreme Brahman."
"14.1 The Blessed Lord said  I will again declare (to thee) that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, having known which all the sages have gone to the supreme perfection after this life.","Shri Bhagwan said - I will repeat the best of all knowledge, which all the saints have learned and from which they have come to the supreme perfection."
"14.2 They who, having taken refuge in this knowledge, have attained to unity with Me, are neither born at the time of creation nor are they disturbed at the time of dissolution.","1.4.2. With the aid of this knowledge, the souls who have received my form (Sardhamyam) are not born in the creation, etc., nor are they troubled in the time of the collapse."
"14.3 My womb is the great Brahma; in that I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings.","14. 3. O India! My supreme Brahman form is nature, the vagina in which I conceive; it is the origin of all beings."
"14.4 Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb and I am the seed-giving father.","14. 4 - LRB - Oh, my God! Of all the idols that arise in the vaginas, the vagina, the womb, is the Brahman, and I am the father of the seed."
"14.5 Purity, passion and inertia  these alities, O Arjuna, born of Nature, bind fast in the body, the embodied, the indestructible.","14. 5 O Mahabharata, these three attributes of nature, Satva, Raj and Tam, bind the divine soul to the body."
"14.6 Of these, Sattva, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by attachment to happiness and by attachment to knowledge, O sinless one.","In these (three), the sainthood is the enlightener and the unceasing by the expiry of purity; He binds (the soul) to the desire of happiness and to the desire of knowledge."
"14.7 Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual enjoyment) and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action.","Know the virtue of love as a passion, which gives rise to lust and affection. It binds the divine soul to the lust for action."
"14.8 But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it binds fast, O Arjuna, by heedlessness, indolence and sleep.","And, O India, be thou born of ignorance, the enchanter of all the souls, the one who binds the soul with power, bliss and sleep."
"14.9 Sattva attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while Tamas verily shrouding knowledge attaches to heedlessness.","14. 9. < s > O India! Satvaगुण encompasses happiness and Rajoगुण encompasses action, but Tamoगुण encompasses knowledge and encompasses the soul with power."
"14.10 Now Sattva arises (prevails), O Arjuna, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; nor Rajas, having overpowered Sattva and Tamas; and now Tamas, having overpowered Sattva and Rajas.","14. 10. O India, sometimes the Satva virtue is enhanced by conquering Raj and Tam, sometimes the Tamo virtue is enhanced by suppressing Raj and Satva, and sometimes the Rajo virtue is enhanced by conquering Tam and Satva."
"14.11 When through every gate (sense) in this body, the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattva is predominant.","When the light of knowledge arises in the doors of this body, i. e. in all the senses, let us know that Sattva is inclined."
"14.12 Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing  these arise when Rajas is predominant, O Arjuna.","14. 12 - LRB - Dear Bharat - Shrestha - RRB -, the prevailing characteristics are greed, tendency to initiate activities, lack of love and selfishness - RRB -."
"14.13 Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusion  these arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna.","14. 13. < s > Dear Kurunandan, when the demonism is pervasive, all these things arise: darkness, reluctance, disgust and envy."
"14.14 If the embodied one meets with death when Sattva is predominant, then he attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.","14. 14. 2. When the soul (the godbeast) receives death in the growth of the sattva virtue, it receives the immortals, that is, the heavenly worlds of the doers of good works."
"14.15 Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless.","14. 15. 2. In the period of Rajoguna, he receives death and is born in the people of Karma - क्ति (mankind) and in the period of Tamoguna (on death) he is born in the elderly."
"14.16 The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattvic and pure, verily the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas.",14. 16. 2. The fruit of good deeds is said to be pure and pure; the fruit of good deeds is said to be evil and the fruit of bad deeds is said to be ignorance.
"14.17 From Sattva arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness and delusion arise from Tamas, and also ignorance.","14.17. Sativa virtue gives rise to knowledge. Rajo virtue gives rise to lust and Tamo virtue gives rise to lust, envy and ignorance."
"14.18 Those who are seated in Sattva go upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards.",14. 18 The males in Satvaगुण go to the upper (worlds); the males in Rajs live in the middle (human world); and the Tashas in the very weak tendencies of Tamoगुण go to the lower.
"14.19 When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas and knows That which is higher than they, he attains to My Being.","14.19. When the seeker - LRB - seeker - RRB - does not see or understand any other being besides the three qualities and knows my element beyond the three qualities, then he gets my form."
"14.20 The embodied one having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay and pain, and attains to immortality.","14. 20. 2. This divine man, as a result of the origin of the body, acquires immortality, freed from birth, death, roots and dust, past the three qualities."
"14.21 Arjuna said  What are the marks of him who has transcended the three alities, O Lord? What is his conduct and how does he go beyond these three alities?","Arjuna said, ""O Prabhu, what are the characteristics of the man who has passed away from these three qualities, what kind of conduct is he, and by what means does he pass away from these three qualities?"""
"14.22 The Blessed Lord said  When light, activity and delusion are present, he hates them not, nor does he long for them when they are absent.","14. 22. Sri Bhagwan said - O Pandva! (the wise man) does not hate him even when he is in the presence of light, tendency and affection, and does not yearn for him when he is retired."
"14.23 He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the alities, and who, knowing that the alities are active, is self-centred and moves not.","14.23. Who cannot be distracted by virtues by being as indifferent as the indifferent, and is in a position to know that ""the virtues act only"" and not to be distracted from that position."
"14.24 Who is the same in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, stone and gold are alike, who is the same to the dear and the unfriendly, who is firm, and to whom censure and praise are as one.","Who is healthy (in spirit), equal in good and evil, and sees in soil, stone and gold; such a brave man equates love and dislike, and contempt and self - praise."
"14.25 Who is the same in honour and dishonour, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakings  he is said to have transcended the alities.","14.25. Who is equal in respect and humiliation; equal in favour of enemy and friend, such a universal renunciation is called a masculine virtue."
"14.26 And he who serves Me with unswerving devotion, he, crossing beyond the alities, is fit for becoming Brahman.","The man who serves me, or worships me, by means of the devotional Yoga of the unmarried becomes capable of becoming Brahman in the past by virtue of these three qualities."
"14.27 For I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal and the immutable, of everlasting Dharma and of absolute bliss.","For I am the prestige of immortality, non - expenditure, Brahman, eternal religion and unity, i.e. non - material happiness."
"15.1 The Blessed Lord said  They (the wise) speak of the indestructible peepul tree having its root above and branches below, whose leaves are the metres or hymns: he who knows it is a knower of the Vedas.","Shri Bhagwan said - (the wise man calls this world tree) the upper root and lower branch of the Ashwattha and the Ashewattha; whose leaves are the Vedas, such (the world tree) as knows it is the Vedvite."
"15.2 Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the Gunas; sense-objects are its buds; and below, in the world of men, stretch forth the roots, originating action.","The branches of that tree are multiplied by virtues, spread downwards and upwards; the subjects are its roots; its other roots, which follow the works in the people of man, are spread downwards."
"15.3 Its form is not perceived here as such, neither its end nor its origin, nor its foundation nor resting place: having cut asunder this firmly rooted peepul tree with the strong axe of non-attachment.","15. 3. The form of this tree, as it is said, is not available here, because it has no beginning, no end and no prestige. Cutting this very strongly rooted Ashwattha tree with a strong armour..."
"15.4 Then That goal should be sought for, whither having gone none returns again. I seek refuge in that Primeval Purusha Whence streamed forth the ancient activity or energy.",15. 4. (Afterwards) it is necessary to explore the post to which the acquired man does not return to the world. “I am the refuge of the primitive man from whom this ancient tendency has emanated. ”
"15.5 Free from pride and delusion, victorious over the evil of attachment, dwelling constantly in the Self, their desires having completely turned away, freed from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded reach the eternal goal.","1.5.5. Those whose values and affections have ceased, who have conquered sin, who are in spirituality, whose desires have ceased and who have been liberated from the conflicts of happiness and evil, such devoid of affection are given the noble position."
"15.6 Neither doth the sun illumine there nor the moon, nor the fire; having gone thither they return not; that is My supreme abode.","No sun can bring it to light, neither the moon nor the fire. That which man does not return to is My supreme abode."
"15.7 An eternal portion of Myself having become a living soul in the world of life, draws to (itself) the (five) senses with the mind for the sixth, abiding in Nature.","In this world of the living, I am the eternal part of the living. It is in nature (at the time of the renunciation of doubt) that it draws to itself the five senses and the mind, i. e., it gathers them."
"15.8 When the Lord (as the individual soul) obtains a body and when He leaves it, He takes these and goes (with them) as the wind takes the scents from their seats (flowers, etc.).","15. 8. When God (living) exhales (from one body), he receives these (sense and mind) and takes them into the other body, just as the odor is taken by air from the odor shelter."
"15.9 Presiding over the ear, the eye, touch, taste and smell, as well as the mind, it enjoys the objects of the senses.","(15.9) (This being) consumes matters by relying on these senses and minds, i. e., the ears, the eye, the touching senses, the smell and the smell."
"15.10 The deluded do not see Him Who departs, stays and enjoys; but they who possess the eye of knowledge behold Him.","15.10. The spirit, integrated in qualities, is not seen by those who abandon the body, are in it, or are experiencing it; (but) it is seen by the men of knowledge."
"15.11 The Yogins striving (for perfection) behold Him dwelling in the Self; but, the unrefined and unintelligent, even though striving, see Him not.","The yogis see the spirit in their hearts as they strive, while the unclean souls and the unconscious do not see it as they strive."
"15.12 That light which residing in the sun illumines the whole world, that which is in the moon and in the fire  know that light to be Mine.","15. 12. You only know the brightness of the sun, which shines upon the whole world, and the brightness of the moon and the fire."

"15.14 Having become the fire Vaisvanara, I abide in the body of living beings and, associated with the Prana and the Apana, digest the fourfold food.","It is I who perceive the four kinds of food contained in life and in aspen, as the fire of the universe in the bodies of all beings."
"15.15 And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory and knowledge, as well as their absence. I am verily That which has to be known by all the Vedas; I am indeed the author of the Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas am I.","I am in the heart of all beings. I am the memory, the knowledge and the absence (of them). Through all the Vedas I am the instrument (knowable), and I am the knower of the Vedanta and the Vedas."
"15.16 Two Purushas there are in this world, the perishable and the imperishable. All beings are 
the perishable and the Kutastha  the unchanging  is called the imperishable.","15. 16. In this world the Kshara (deity) and the letter (deity) are two men, all the deities are Kshara and the letter 'Kutastha' is called."
"15.17 But distinct is the Supreme Purusha called the highest Self, the indestructible Lord Who, pervading the three worlds, sustains them.",But the best man is the one who is called the Almighty and who enters into the three worlds and holds them all.
"15.18 As I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am declared to be the highest Purusha in the world and in the Vedas.","Since I am better than the past and better than the letter, I am known as Purushaottam in the Lok and the Vedas."

Fastness, forgiveness, patience, purity, devotion and lack of superstition are the characteristics of a man who has acquired divine wealth."
"16.4 Hypocrisy, arrogance and self-conceit, anger and also harshness and ignorance, belong to one who is born for a demoniacal state, O Partha (Arjuna).","16. 4 - LRB - Oh, my Lord! - RRB -, repulsion, pride, anger, harsh speech and ignorance - RRB -, all these are the possessions of the evil one."
"16.5 The divine nature is deemed conducive to liberation, and the demoniacal to bondage. Grieve not, O Arjuna, thou art born with divine endowments.","16. 5 O Pandavas! The Divine Estate is considered for redemption and the Asuri Estate for bondage, do not mourn, for you have received the Divine Estate."
"16.6 There are two types of beings in this world, the divine and the demoniacal; the divine has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the demoniacal.","There are two kinds of earth creations in this world, the deities and the aसुरs. The nature of the deities is extensively described in them; now the nature of the aसुरs is described by Vistaresh: Listen to me."
"16.7 The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity, nor right conduct nor truth is found in them.","The people of the Asuri nature know neither the tendency nor the renunciation, neither purification nor righteousness nor truth."
"16.8 They say, ""This universe is without truth, without (moral) basis, without a God, brought about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else?""","He says that this world is unreliable, untrue and ungodly, it has arisen only from intercourse, and what can be the cause?"
"16.9 Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellect and fierce deeds, come forth as the enemies of the world for its destruction.","By deferring this view, the wise, bad - doing people of the destructive nature are born to destroy it as the enemy of the world."
"16.10 Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure resolves.","16.10. These people of unclean wills work in the world by embracing false ideas for the sake of ever - unfulfilling desires of dumbness, value and substance."
"16.11 Giving themselves over to immeasurable cares ending only with death, regarding gratification of lust as their highest aim, and feeling sure that that is all.","16. 11. 12. These Asuri people, who are boundlessly anxious to die and regard sex as their supreme goal, are convinced that this is what is true."
"16.12 Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and anger, they strive to obtain by unlawful means hoards to wealth for sensual enjoyments.","16. 12. 12. Deprived of hundreds of hopefuls, they seek unjustly to accumulate wealth to satisfy their desires, owing to work and anger."
"16.13 ""This has been gained by me today; this desire of mine I shall fuffil; this is mine and this wealth also shall be mine in future.""","I have found this today and I will get this mood, I have this much money and more money in the future."

""I am born in a rich and noble family. Who is like me?"", ""I will sacrifice,"" ""I will give,"" ""I will sacrifice"" - they are fascinated by this kind of ignorance."
"16.16 Bewildered by many a fancy, entangled in the snare of delusion, addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall into a foul hell.","16. 16. The many kinds of confused psychics, hooked on the illusions and obsessed with pleasures, they fall into a cruel, unclean hell."
"16.17 Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices in name out of ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinances.","16.17. Those who consider themselves superior, who are devout, wealthy and devout to the cause of dignity, do the shameful sacrifices of a mere name, without the instruction of scripture."
"16.18 Given over to egoism, power, haughtiness, lust and anger, these malicious people hate Me in their own bodies and in those of others.","Those who hate egoism, power, pride, work and anger are haters of me in their own bodies and those of others."
"16.19 Those cruel haters, worst among men in the world, I hurl those evil-doers into the wombs of demons only.","16. 19. I repeatedly cast such haters, cruelty - makers and criminals into the world, i. e., I create them."
"16.20 Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded, birth after birth, not attaining Me, they thus fall, O Arjuna, into a condition still lower than that.","16. 20. < s > Oh, my God! they get the Asuri vagina in the birth of the foolish man and (in this way) they get the sub - movement instead of me."
"16.21 Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the self  lust, anger and greed; therefore one should abandon these three.","16.21. Job, anger and greed are the three doors to self - destruction, so these three must be abandoned."
"16.22 A man who is liberated from these three gates to darkness, O Arjuna, practises what is good for him and thus goes to the Supreme Goal.",16. 22. “He who is freed from these three gates of hell acts as a means of his own welfare and thus obtains para - movement. ”
"16.23 He who, having cast aside the ordinances of the scriptures, acts under the impulse of desire, attains not perfection, nor happiness nor the Supreme Goal.","16.23. A man who abandons the philosophy and acts only by his own desire does not achieve perfection, nor happiness, nor transcendence."
"16.24 Therefore, let the scripture be thy authority in determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou shouldst act here in this world.","Therefore, to you, the Scripture is the proof of the system of duty and duty - LRB - decision - RRB -, and you should do your work knowing the laws aforesaid."
"17.1 Arjuna said  Those who, setting aside the ordinances of the scriptures, perform sacrifice with faith, what is their condition, O Krishna? Is is Sattva, Rajas or Tamas?","17. 1 - Arjun said, ""O Krishna, what is the position of those who sacrifice devoutly, abandoning the orthodoxy? Is it sacred, or is it royal, or is it thematic?"
"17.2 The Blessed Lord said  Threefold is the faith of the embodied, which is inherent in their nature  the Sattvic (pure), the Rajasic (passionate) and the Tamasic (dark). Do thou hear of it.","17. 2. Shri Bhagwan said - Hear from me that the natural (unknown) faith of the people of the earth is of three kinds - essential, royal and thematic."
"17.3 The faith of each is in accordance with his nature, O Arjuna. The man consists of his faith; as a man's faith is, so is he.","This man is devout, therefore he who has faith is the same, i. e. he who has faith is the same in form."
17.4 The Sattvic or the pure men worship the gods; the Rajasic or the passionate worship the Yakshas and the Rakshasas; the others (the Tamasic or the deluded people) worship the ghosts and the hosts of the nature-spirits.,"17. 4.

"17.7 The food also which is dear to each is threefold, as also sacrifice, austerity and almsgiving. Hear thou the distinction of these.","17. 7 (According to your own nature) There are three kinds of food beloved to all, just as there are three kinds of sacrifice, penance and charity. Ask me about their differences."

The sacrifice which is regulated by the law of sacrifice and which is done by people who do not aspire to a fruit by settling their minds by saying, ""This is my duty,"" is essential."
"17.12 The sacrifice which is offered, O Arjuna, seeking a reward and for ostentation, know thou that to be a Rajasic Yajna.","17. 12. < s > O Bharatshreshtha Arjuna, think of the sacrifice which is offered for the fig tree and for the fruit, as Rajas."
"17.13 They declare that sacrifice to be Tamasic which is contrary to the ordinances of the scriptures, in which no food is distributed, which is devoid of Mantras, gifts and faith.","17.13. The sacrifice without scripture, without food offering, without mantras, without Dakshina and without reverence is called the 'Tamas Yajna'."
"17.14 Worship of the gods, the twice-born, the teachers and the wise, purity, straightforwardness, celibacy and non-injury are called the austerities of the body.","17.14. The worship of gods, goddesses (brahmins), gurus and wise people, passions, arrogance, brahminism and non - violence is called body - related तप."

The asthma which is performed for sainthood, worship and worship, or only from the stem, is here called Rajas, an uncertain and temporary asthma."

""Giving is the duty"" - In this sense, a gift given to a (qualified) recipient (person) who is not expected to receive a reply, in view of the time, is considered to be essential."

"17.26 The word ï1Satï1 is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and so also, O Arjuna, the word ï1Satï1 is used in the sense of an auspicious act.","The word 'Sat' is used in true feeling and sacredness, and the word 'Sat' is used in praise - LRB - good - doing - RRB -."
"17.27 Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and gift, is also called 'Sat' and also action in connection with these (or for the sake of the Supreme) is called 'Sat'.","17. 27.
