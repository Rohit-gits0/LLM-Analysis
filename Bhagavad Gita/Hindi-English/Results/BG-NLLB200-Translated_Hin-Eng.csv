together eager for battle on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya.","Dhrutrasat said, ""O Sanjay! What did the war-loving sons of Pandhu and I do when they gathered at Dharmabhoomi Kurukshetra?"

"1.10. ""This army of ours marshalled by Bhishma is insufficient,
whereas that army of theirs marshelled by Bhima is sufficient.","1.10. Our army protected by Bhishma is insufficient; but his army protected by Bhim is sufficient; or, our army protected by Bhishma is infinite but his army protected by Bhim is limited."

in the several divisions of the army, protect Bhishma alone.""","1.11. Standing in your places on different fronts, all of you defend Bhimpatam Mahasa from all sides."

in order to cheer Duryodhana, now roared like a lion, and blew his conch.","1.12. At that time, the elderly, glorious Father Bhimsa, in the Kauravas, thundered in a loud voice, making the heart of him rejoice."
"1.13. Then (following Bhishma), conches and kettledrums, tabors,
drums and cow horns blared forth ite suddenly (from the Kaurava side)
and the sound was tremendous.","Then the horn, the horn, the drum and the horn, and the instruments of the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the horn, and the harp, and the harp, and the harp, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, and the string, all together, sounded."
"1.14. Then, also, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna),
seated in the magnificent chariot, yoked with white horses, blew divine
conches.","1.14 After this, Madhva (Srikrishna) and Panduthapura Arjuna, sitting in a magnificent chariot of white horses, also played their divine horns."
"1.15. Hrishikesha blew the Panchajanya and Arjuna blew the Devadatta

"1.19. That tumultuous sound rent the hearts of (the members of)
Dhritarashtra's party, making both the heaven and the earth resound.",The terrible horse began to resound in the sky and the earth and he made the hearts of the sons of Dhruthrasad displease.
"1.20. Then, seeing the people of Dhritarashtra’s party standing
arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of
Pandu, whose ensign was a monkey, took up his bow and said the following
to Krishna, O Lord of the earth.","1.20. O Mahipete! Thus, when the war was about to begin, the Kapidhagga Arjuna, seeing the sons of Dharthrasat standing, lifted his bow and said these words to Lord Hishikesh."
"1.21 Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.",1.21. Arjuna said - Hey! Achut my chariot stand between the two armies.
"1.22. Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.",1.22 - so that I can observe these people who stand by the will to fight in this war with whom I have to fight.
"1.23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight,
wishing to please in battle the evil-minded Duryodhana (the son of Dhritarashtra).",1.23 I will see those who fight the war of the Darybuddhi Dharthrasad (Duryodhan) who are the beloved ones who are gathered here.
"1.24. Sanjaya said  Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna, having stationed that
best of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies.","1.24 Sanjay said - O India (Dharth Rashtra) - upon the words of Arjuna like this, Lord Hishikesh stood the best chariot between the two armies."
"1.25. In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the
earth, said: ""O Arjuna (son of Pritha), behold these Kurus gathered together.""","1.25 He said before Bhishma, Drona and all the rulers of the earth, ""O Parth, look at the Kauravas gathered here""."
"1.26. Then, Arjuna (son of Pritha) saw there (in the armies) stationed,
fathers and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons
and friends too.","There Arjuna also saw his father 's brothers, grandfathers, aunts, mothers, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, sons - in - law and daughters - in - law standing in both armies."
"1.27. (He saw) fathers-in-law and friends also in both the armies.
The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those kinsmen thus standing arrayed,
spoke this, sorrowfully filled with deep pity.","Thus, seeing all those prisoners standing, Kunti son Arjuna was filled with compassion and said this poisoned."
"1.28. Arjuna said  Seeing these, my kinsmen, O krishna, arrayed, eager to fight.","Arjuna said, ""Krishna, when I see these comrades who are willing to fight, my organs become relaxed, my mouth becomes dry and my body is trembling and thrilling."
"1.29. My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body ivers and
my hair stands on end.","Arjuna said, ""Krishna, when I see these compatriots who are willing to fight, my organs become relaxed, my mouth becomes dry and my body is trembling and thrilling."
"1.30. The (bow) Gandiva slips from my hand, and also my skins burns
all over; I am unable even to stand and my mind is reeling, as it were.","1.30. I have a falling arrow in my hand and a burning skin. My mind is getting a little confused, and I am unable to stand."
"1.31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava. I do not see any good
in killing my kinsmen in battle.","1.31 O Keshva, I see the Shakunas in the opposite direction and I see no good in killing my own people in war."
"1.32. I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.
Of what avail is dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?","1.32 O Krishna, I do not desire victory, nor kingdom or happiness. O Govind, what is the purpose of living by kingdom or by pleasure?"
"1.33. Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,
stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.","1.33. Those of us who desire kingdom, luxury and pleasure are the ones who stand in battle, giving up the hope of wealth and life."
"1.34. Teachers, fathers, sons and also grandfathers, maternal uncles,
fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives,-","1.34 These are Gurujan, Tau, uncle, son, father, father - in - law, grandchildren, great - brothers and other relatives."
"1.35. These I do not wish to kill, though they kill me, O Krishna,
even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds; leave alone killing
them for the sake of the earth.","1.35 O Madhusudan, I do not want to kill them for them to kill me or for the kingdom of the Trilogy, then what to say for the earth."
"1.36. By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can
be ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue to us from killing these felons.","1.36 O gentlemen, what pleasure shall we have in killing the sons of Dhruthrasat?"
"1.37. Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra,
our relatives; for how can we be happy by killing our own people, O Madhava
(Krishna)?","1.37 O Madhavan, therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of our bandha Dhrutrasat, for how can we be happy by killing our own people?"
"1.38. Though they, with intelligence overpowered by greed, see
no evil in the destruction of families, and no sin in hostility to friends,","1.38 Although corrupted by greed, they do not see the sin in sexual offences and treachery."
"1.39. Why should not we who clearly see evil in the destruction
of families, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana (Krishna)?","But, gentlemen, why should we not consider how to avoid this sin, knowing the guilt of the whole body?"
"1.40. In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious
rites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety,
indeed, overcomes the whole family.","1.40 The destruction of the whole is the destruction of eternal religions. When religion is destroyed, the whole whole is crushed by iniquity."
"1.41. By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of
the family become corrupt; and , women being corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant
of Vrishni), there arises intermingling of castes.","1.41 O Krishna, the increase of sin corrupts the women of the clan, and O Varshna, the corruption of women produces the sexuality."
"1.42. Confusion of castes leads to hell the slayers of the family,
for their forefathers fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-ball and
water (libations).",1.42 He causes the Varna - Skar to take the Kallaghis and the Kalla to Hell.
"1.43. By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which
cause confusion of castes, the eternal religious rites of the caste and
the family are destroyed.",1.43 These characteristic factors cause the destruction of the whole of the Sunnat Kulthad and Caste Dharma by the total defects.
"1.44. We have heard, O Janardana, that inevitable is the dwelling
for an unknown period in hell for those men in whose families the religious
practices have been destroyed.",We have heard that those whose religion is destroyed are in hell forever.
"1.45. Alas! We are involved in a great sin, in that we are
prepared to kill our kinsmen, through greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.","Alas, we have decided to commit a grave sin, which is to destroy our family by the lust of this kingdom."
"1.46. If the sons of Dhritarashtra with weapons in hand should
slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.","1.46 If these armed men should kill the unarmed and unresisting one in a cowardly battle, it would be good for me."
"1.47. Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna,
casting away his bow and arrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot with
his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.",1.47 Sanjay said - In the Ranbhoomi (number) he was upset with the sadness and Manwala Arjuna said this and abandoned the bow with the arrows and sat in the back of the chariot.
"2.1 Sanjaya said  To him who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, Madhusudana (the destroyer of Madhu) or Krishna spoke these words.","2.1. Sanjay said - Thus Madhusudan said this sentence to Akul Arjun with tear - filled eyes, filled with compassion and poison."
"2.2 The Blessed Lord said  Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of you, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon you, O Arjuna?","Shri Bhagwan said, ""Arjuna, where did you get this attraction in this strange place? It is neither a means of attaining heaven nor a means of achieving fame, as opposed to the Aryan practice."
"2.3 Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha. It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean weakness of the heart! Stand up, O scorcher of the foes!","Do not be weary, O Lord. This is disgraceful to you. But let go of the small weakness of your heart and stand up."
"2.4 Arjuna said  How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?","2.4. Arjuna said - O Madhusudan! How shall I fight with the arrows with Bhishma and Drona in battle ground. O Arisudan, they are both revered."
"2.5 Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires will be stained with (their) blood.","2.5. To eat the food of the Biksha in this folk is more beneficial than killing these majestic gurus, for by killing the gurus I will experience the bloody meaning and work form of the Bhagavad Gita in this folk."
"2.6 I can hardly tell which will be better, that we should  coner them or that they should coner us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us.","We do not know what is right for us to do. We do not even know whether we will win, or they will win us, the ones we do not want to kill to survive are the sons of Dhruthrasat who stand before us for war."
2.7 My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity; my mind is confused as to duty. I ask Thee: Tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who has taken refuge in Thee.,"2.7 . Overwhelmed with the passion of compassion and confused by the path of duty, I ask you to say what is best for me, for I am your disciple. Come to the refuge and teach me yourself."
"2.8 I do not see that it would remove this sorrow that burns up my senses, even if I should attain prosperous and unrivalled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods.","2.8. Even with the unlimited wealth of the earth and the possession of the gods, I do not see a way to remove this sadness that dries my senses."
"2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the coneror of sleep), the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna, ""I will not fight"" and became silent.","2.9. Sanjay said - thus GudaKesh Paranthap Arjuna silenced Lord Hishikesh by saying, ""O Govind, I will not fight""."
"2.10 To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Krishna, as if smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words.",2.10. O India (Dharth Rashtra) This word was said by Lord Hishikesh laughing at the saddened Arjuna in the midst of the two armies.
"2.11 The Blessed Lord said  Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.","2.11. Shri Bhagwan said -- (Ashokhan) You mourn for those for whom it is not right to mourn and speak words to the wise, but the wise do not mourn for the dead and the living."
"2.12 Nor at any time indeed was I not, nor thou, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease to be hereafter.","It is not that I was not in a time, or you were not in a time, or these were not kings, nor is it that we will not all be ahead of this."
"2.13 Just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does it pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat.","2.13. Just as in this body the virginity, youth and old age of the bodily soul is obtained, so in this body the patient man is not enticed."
"2.14 The contacts of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold, pleasure and pain, have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna.","O Kuntiputra, the combination of cold and hot and pleasure and painful senses and subjects is the beginning and the end; they are eternal, therefore, O India, bear them."
"2.15 That firm man whom, surely, these afflict not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality.","O Mansherratha, the patient man who lives equally in pain and happiness, who cannot be afflicted by these, is the possessor of immortality."
2.16 The unreal hath no being; there is non-being of the real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the Truth (or the seers of the Essence).,2.16 The existence of the Absolute is not there and the absence of the Satt is never there. Thus the essence of both has been seen by philosophical wise men.
"2.17 Know that to be indestructible, by Which all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable.","Know that the thing which is indestructible, which is the whole world, cannot be destroyed."
"2.18 These bodies of the embodied Self, Which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore fight, O Arjuna.","All these bodies of this incorruptible, unloved, eternal body of soul are called incorruptible."
"2.19 He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks It is slain, neither of them ï1knowsï1. It slays not, nor is It slain.","2.19. He who thinks that the soul is dead and he who thinks that it is dead both know not, because this soul does not die and does not die."
"2.20 It is not born, nor does It ever die; after having been, It again ceases not to be; unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed.","2.20. This spirit is not born at any time and does not die nor is it to be reborn once. This spirit is immortal, eternal, eternal and ancient, it does not perish even when the body is destroyed."
"2.21 Whosoever knows It to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and inexhaustible, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain?","O Parth, how can a man who knows this soul as immortal, eternal and immortal kill and kill whom?"
"2.22 Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new.","2.22 As man discards old garments and puts on new ones, so the body soul discards old bodies and acquires new ones."
"2.23 Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not.","The soul cannot be cut off by weapons, nor can it be burned by fire; water cannot make it wet, nor can the air dry it."
"2.24 This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted, nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and ancient.","2.24. Because this soul is gooddy (cuts), adahaya (burns), akledy (does not get wet) and ashousha (does not dry); it is perpetual, universal, permanent, unchanging and eternal."
"2.25 This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve.","This spirit is called unconscious, uncertain and unresponsive, so you should not grieve knowing it."
"2.26 But even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve.","And if you think you are eternally born and eternally dying, then, O woe, you should not mourn in this way."
"2.27 For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve.","The one who is born is certain to die and the one who is dying is certain to be born; therefore, do not grieve over what is inevitable."
"2.28 Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifested again in their end. What is there to grieve about?","O India, all creatures live in the unconscious state before birth and after death and express themselves in the middle."
"2.29 One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet having heard, none understands It at all.","2.29. Some see it as a wonder, some speak of it as a wonder, and some hear it as a wonder, and then no one hear and know."
"2.30 This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is ever indestructible, O Arjuna; therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.","O India, this bodily spirit is always immortal in the body of all, so you should not grieve for all living beings."
"2.31 Further, having regard to thy duty, shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.","And you should not be distracted by the self - religion, because there is no other duty of goodness for the Khthriya than the righteous war."
"2.32 Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna! who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself as an open door to heaven.","And, O Parth, the lucky ones who have attained and opened the gates to heaven find this kind of war."
"2.33 But if thou wilt not fight this righteous war, then having abandoned thine own duty and fame, thou shalt incur sin.","And if you do not accept this war of religion, you will lose your self - faith and reputation and gain sin."
"2.34 People, too, will recount thy everlasting dishonour; and to one who has been honoured, dishonour is worse than death.","And everyone will continue to call you a long - lived miscarriage; and for a respectable man, miscarriage is more than death."
2.35 The great car-warriors will think that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear; and thou wilt be lightly held by them who have thought much of thee.,"And you will now be despised by those for whom you are most honorable, the masters will consider you retired from the war because of fear."
"2.36 Thy enemies also, cavilling at thy power, will speak many abusive words. What is more painful than this?","If your enemies speak many words of reproach for your goodness, what more painful will it be?"
"2.37 Slain, thou wilt obtain heaven; victorious, thou wilt enjoy the earth; therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight.","If you die in battle you will gain heaven or if you win you will inherit the earth. So stand up, O Kauntai, and decide the battle."
"2.38 Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shalt not incur sin.","Prepare for war, in the same way as happiness, pain, loss, and victory, and you will not sin."
"2.39 This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdon concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action.","O Parth, you have been called to know the mathematics and now listen to the knowledge of this yoga which you can destroy the karma by using."
"2.40 In this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm (production of contrary results or transgression). Even a little of this knowledge (even a little practice of this Yoga) protects one from great fear.",2.40 It has no corruption and no extravial defect. The small practice of this religion (Yoga) also protects from great fear.
"2.41 Here, O joy of the Kurus, there is but a single one-pointed determination; many-branched and endless are the thoughts of the irresolute.","2.41 O Kurunandan, the decisive wisdom in this is the same, the wisdom of the ignorant men is very varied and infinite."
"2.42 Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, taking pleasure in the eulogising words of the Vedas, O Arjuna, saying, ""There is nothing else.""","O foolish men who delight in Vedicism who speak this flowery voice, there is nothing better than this."
"2.43 Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, (they utter speech which is directed to ends) leading to new births as the result of their works, and prescribe various methods abounding in specific actions, for the attainment of pleasure and power.",2.43 Those who consider heaven to be the supreme are those who describe various actions which bring about pleasure and wealth which are (in fact) the birth - form of karma.
"2.44 For those who are attached to pleasure and power, whose minds are drawn away by such teaching, ï1thatï1 determinate reason is not formed which is steadily bent on meditation and Samadhi (superconscious state).","2.44. The minds of men who are taken away from him, who are dependent on such luxuries and devotions, have no definite wisdom, i.e. they are not capable of meditation."
"2.45 The Vedas deal with the three attributes (of Nature); be thou above these three attributes. O Arjuna, free yourself from the pairs of opposites, and ever remain in the ality of Sattva (goodness), freed from (the thought of) acisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.","2.45 O Arjuna, the subject of the Vedas is related to three qualities: you are in trinity, in purity, in purity, in purity, in yoga, and in self."
"2.46 To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.","2.46 - As much purpose as a man has in a small reservoir when he has a full water supply from all sides, so much purpose has the self - conscious Brahmin in all the Vedas."
"2.47 Thy right is to work only, but never with its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction.","Do you have the right to do only the work? Never to be fruitful. Do not be fruitful in your work, and do not be dependent on doing wrong."
"2.48 Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.","2.48 O Dhananjaya, renounce the asceticism and act in yoga, being in harmony with the Siddha and the Asiddha."
"2.49 Far lower than the Yoga of wisdon is action, O Arjuna. Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are they whose motive is the fruit.","The works are more miserable than the wisdom. So take refuge in wisdom, O rich man, and be a fruitful giver."
"2.50 Endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action.",2.50 The man of the same mind here (in this life) abandons both virtue and sin. So become devoted to yoga.
"2.51 The wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil.","2.51 The manish with intellect, by giving up the fruits of karma, attain the status of an anonymous, that is, innocent, free from the bonds of birth."
"2.52 When thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard.","When your mind is turned to mud (kalkalli), you will get untouched by all that is heard and heard."
"2.53 When thy intellect, which is perplexed by the Veda text, which thou hast read, shall stand immovable and steady in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-realisation.","When you are distracted from listening to various subjects, your mind becomes fixed and stable in the self - form and you will attain (Paramath) Yoga."
"2.54 Arjuna said  What, O Krishna, is the description of him who has steady wisdom, and is merged in the superconscious state? How does one of steady wisdom speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?",2.54 . Arjuna said -- what is the characteristic of a man with stable intelligence in the Keshva Samadhi?
"2.55 The Blessed Lord said  When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom.","2.55 Lord said - O Parth? The time when man gives up all desires in the mind and is content with the soul in the soul, he is called the state pradesh."
"2.56 He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures, and is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.","A man whose mind is not agitated in sorrow, whose spirit is retired from happiness, whose mind is destroyed by anger, fear and anger, is called a bottom - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
"2.57 He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, who neither rejoices not hastes, his wisdom is fixed.","He who is not pleased with the good and the bad, and who is not averse to it, and who is not overly affectionate, is a man of great wisdom."
"2.58 When, like the tortoise which withdraws on all sides its limbs, he withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, then his wisdom becomes steady.","2.58 Like a turtle, he is able to hold his organs together, and his mind is stable when he is able to hold his senses together."
2.59 The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man leaving the longing (behind); but his longing also turns away on seeing the Supreme.,"2.59 The subject of the unhealthy body is retired from the man, but not the rage towards him, but the rage of this man is also retired when he sees the Supreme Being."
"2.60 The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise man though he be striving (to control them).","2.60. O Kauntey (control) in the effort of the wise man, these senses take over the mind with force."
"2.61 Having restrained them all he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control.",2.61 . Be self - controlled and self - controlled in all these senses. The wisdom of a man who is subject to his senses is distinguished.
"2.62 When a man thinks of the objects, attachment for them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises.",2.62 The man who thinks about matters becomes addicted to it.
2.63 From anger comes delusion; from delusion loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; from the destruction of discrimination he perishes.,"2.63 Anger is the result of mourning and memory confusion is the result of mourning. When memory is confused, the mind is destroyed and when intelligence is destroyed, the human being is destroyed."
"2.64 But the self-controlled man, moving among the objects with the senses under restraint and free from attraction and repulsion, attains to peace.","2.64 Self - controlled man obtains pleasure from subjects through his subjective senses, without ragadishness."
2.65 In that peace all pains are destroyed; for the intellect of the tranil-minded soon becomes steady.,"2.65 With Prasad, all sorrows are ended and the mind of the contented man is soon stabilized."
"2.66 There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady and to the unsteady no meditation is possible, and to the unmeditative there can be no peace, and to the man who has no peace, how can there be happiness?",2.66 The Commissioner has no knowledge of himself and the Commissioner has no capacity for feeling and meditation The Man without feeling finds no comfort The restless man finds no pleasure
"2.67 For the mind, which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters.","2.67 Like the wind in the water which takes a boat, so does the one which it emulates in the midst of the senses which are scattered in the subjects, take its wisdom."
"2.68 Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from sense-objects.","Therefore, O Mahabah, the mind of a man whose senses are all subject to the subjects of the senses is fixed."
"2.69 That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man is awake; when all beings are awake, that is night for the Muni (sage) who sees.","The night of all lovers is the night wherein the man of restraint awakens, and wherein all beings awaken, it is the night for the man of sight."
"2.70 He attains peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean which, filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the man who is full of desires.","As the waters of the seas are absorbed by the waters of the rivers, which are full of unchanging stature, so is he who is absorbed by the desires of the man, who is not a man who desires pleasure."
"2.71 That man attains peace who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without the sense of mine and without egoism.","2.71 A man who abandons all desires and wanders without concern, without affection and without self - concern, will find peace."
"2.72 This is the Brahmic seat (eternal state), O son of Pritha. Attaining to this, none is deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life, one attains to oneness with Brahman.","2.72 O Parth, this is the Brahmin state. It is not the man who is attracted by it."
"3.1 Arjuna said  If Thou thinkest that knowledge is superior to action, O Krishna, why then, O Kesava, dost Thou ask me to engage in this terrible action?","3.1. If you believe that knowledge is superior to karma, then why do you induce me to this terrible act, O Kesha?"
"3.2 With this apparently perplexing speech, Thou confusest, as it were, my understanding; therefore tell me that one way for certain by which I may attain bliss.",3.2. You have fascinated my mind with this compound sentence so you can definitely tell me the one way that I can get the ultimate credit.
"3.3 The Blessed Lord said  In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one; the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogins.","3.3. Lord said, O innocent Arjuna, in this verse two kinds of devotion have been mentioned by me before, the knowledge of the sages and the karma of the yogis."
3.4 Not by non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection.,3.4. Not doing works does not bring about man 's nairshkamya and not by the cessation of works does he attain to perfection.
3.5 Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for everyone is made to act helplessly indeed by the alities born of Nature.,"3.5. No man can ever remain momentarily without doing, for all the remaining (men) are done by virtues derived from nature."
"3.6 He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he of deluded understanding is called a hypocrite.",3.6. The foolish intellect who is mindful of the pleasures of the senses by indulging the male carmen is called a falsifier.
"3.7 But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels.","3.7. But, O Arjuna, the man who exercises Karma Yoga from the unabated Karmenandras by subduing the senses of the mind is superior."
"3.8 Do thou perform (thy) bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction and even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for thee by inaction.","Do your duty, for it is better than undoing. If you do not do your duty, your body will not be perfect."
"3.9 The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment.","3.9. The man who is engaged in other works besides the one done for the sacrifice is bound by the works. Therefore, O Kauntya, abandon the attachment and conduct the work in the name of the sacrifice."
"3.10 The Creator, having in the beginning (of creation) created mankind together with sacrifice, said, ""By this shall ye propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires (the cow which yields all the desired objects).""","3.10. Prajapati (Saratikarta) created the Prasa with Yaj in the beginning and said, ""By this Yaj you achieve growth and this Yaj will fulfill the desires you desire for you""."
"3.11 With this do ye nourish the gods and may those gods nourish you; thus nourishing one another, ye shall attain to the highest good.",3.11. You should make progress on the part of the gods through this sacrifice and they should make progress on you.
"3.12 The gods, nourished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. So, he who enjoys the objects given by the gods without offering (in return) to them, is verily a thief.",3.12. The gods nourished by the Yajna will provide you with the pleasures they give. The man who enjoys the pleasures they give without giving them is certainly a thief.
3.13 The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are freed from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food (only) for their own sake verily eat sin.,"The best men who eat the remaining grain of the sacrifice are absolved of all sins, but those who cook only for themselves eat only sins."
3.14 From food come forth beings; from rain food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain and sacrifice is born of action.,3. 14. All beings are born from grain. The origin of grain is from purgation. The origin of purgation is from Yogin and Yogin.
"3.15 Know thou that action comes from Brahma and Brahma comes from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervading (Brahma) ever rests in sacrifice.","3.15 Karma originates from Brahmaji and is expressed by Brahmaji letters. Therefore, the universal Brahma is always distinguished in the Yajna."
"3.16 He who does not follow here the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Arjuna.","3.16 The man who does not follow the cycle thus instituted here, who indulges in the sense of sin, lives in vain."
"3.17 But for that man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self and who is content in the Self alone, verily there is nothing to do.",But the one who rejoices in the Spirit is satisfied in the Spirit and satisfied in the Spirit is not obliged.
3.18 For him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object.,"3. 18. In this world, the man has no purpose by deed or by nature, nor does he depend on the ghost for anything."
"3.19 Therefore without attachment, do thou always perform action which should be done; for by performing action without attachment man reaches the Supreme.","Therefore, do your duty always without being discouraged, for the discouraged man receives the Spirit by working."
3.20 Janaka and others attained perfection verily by action only; even with a view to the protection of the masses thou shouldst perform action.,3.20. Jankadhi (Khanni Jan) also see the folk collection (Lok Rakhshan) which is the only way to gain consciousness through the work; you are worthy of doing the work.
"3.21 Whatsoever a great man does, that the other men also do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world (mankind) follows.","3.21. The best man behaves as the others do; the man who proves, the people follow him."
"3.22 There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that should be done by Me, nor is there anything unattained that should be attained; yet I engage Myself in action.","3. 22. Although I have no duty in the triad and not a little thing to be gained is unattainable, I still perform in the karmā."
"3.23 For, should I not ever engage Myself in action, unwearied, men would in every way follow My path, O Arjuna.","If I had been cautious, perhaps I would have done nothing, O Parth, and men would have followed my way."
3.24 These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; I should be the author of confusion of castes and destruction of these beings.,"If I do not act, all these peoples will perish; and I will be a transgressor and a harasser of this people."
"3.25 As the ignorant men act from attachment to action, O Bharata (Arjuna), so should the wise act without attachment, wishing the welfare of the world.","3. 25. O India, as the ignorant man who is obsessed with work does, so let the learned man act with the will of the people - welfare."
"3.26 Let no wise man unsettle the mind of ignorant people who are attached to action; he should engage them in all actions, himself fulfilling them with devotion.","3.26. A wise man, do not deceive the minds of the ignorant who are obsessed with deeds, but do the same to them with your own devotion."
"3.27 All actions are wrought in all cases by the alities of Nature only. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks, ""I am the doer.""","3. 27. All works are done by the virtues of nature, a man enticed by ego assumes, ""I am the doer""."
"3.28 But he who knows the Truth, O mighty-armed (Arjuna), about the divisions of the alities and (their) functions, knowing that the Gunas as senses move amidst the Gunas as the sense-objects, is not attached.","But, O Mahabah, a wise man who knows the truth of the department of virtue and work is not obsessed with the knowledge that ""virtues are the result of virtue""."
3.29 Those deluded by the alities of Nature are attached to the functions of the alities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one who is of imperfect knowledge.,"3.29 Men who are enticed by the qualities of nature are obsessed with virtue and work, do not let the man who is fully knowledgeable distract the men who are imperfectly wise."
"3.30 Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred in the Self, free from hope and egoism, and from (mental) fever, do thou fight.","3.30 Fight without fear, without hope, without compassion, with all your works in me."
"3.31 Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine with faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from actions.","Those who follow My commands without any sense of guilt and devotion, are exempt from their deeds."
"3.32 But those who carp at My teaching and do not practise it, deluded of all knowledge, and devoid of discrimination, know them to be doomed to destruction.",But you will see that those who are foolish and do not follow my teaching are destroyed by the foolish minds of those who are enticed by this knowledge.
"3.33 Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature; beings will follow Nature; what can 
restraint do?","3.33. The wise man also works according to his nature. All beings go according to their nature, then what will the grace of any one do."
"3.34 Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses; let none come under their sway; for, they are his foes.",3.34. The subject of the senses (i.e. each of the senses) is hated; man should not be subject to them both; for they are his enemies.
"3.35 Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear (is productive of danger).",3.35. It is better to practice a self - worship without qualities than a practiced religion; death in self - worship is beneficial (but) it is fear - inspiring.
"3.36 Arjuna said  But impelled by what does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O Varshneya (Krishna), constrained as it were, by force?","3.36 - Arjuna said - Oh Varshnae! Then by whom does this man act as a sinner, being driven by the same unwillingness as he is forced to?"
"3.37 The Blessed Lord said  It is desire, it is anger both of the ality of Rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as the foe here (in this world).","3.37 Shri Bhagavan said - this is the wish, this is the anger, this is the Mahasana (which is hungry and greatly sinful), this is what you should consider an enemy here."
"3.38 As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by the amnion, so is this enveloped by that.","3.38. As smoke covers mirrors with fire and dust and as the fetus is covered with the uterus, so it is circulated by it."
"3.39 O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire.","O Kaunthai, knowledge is surrounded by this perpetual enemy of the wise, such a work as fire, which is difficult to satisfy."
"3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom.","The senses, mind and intellect are called its abode; it is through them that the body of man is enticed by the act of covering up knowledge."
"3.41 Therefore, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation.","Therefore, O Arjuna, first conquer the senses and destroy this sinful act, the destroyer of knowledge and science."
3.42 They say that the senses are superior (to the body); superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; one who is superior even to the intellect is He (the Self).,"There are said to be the best of the senses, the mind is above the senses, and the wisdom is above the mind, and the spirit is beyond the intelligence."
"3.43 Thus knowing Him Who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to coner.","So, knowing the Spirit beyond wisdom, subdue the spirit by the Spirit, saying, ""Woe to you, O king! Kill this vile enemy of evil""."
4.1 The Blessed Lord said  I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku.,4.1. Shri Bhagavan said -- I called this indestructible yoga to Vivaswan (Sun God); Vivaswan said to Manu; Manu said to Ikshvaku.
"4.2 This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by long lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa (burner of the foes).","4.2. Thus this yoga derived from tradition was known to the Rajasri, (but) O Paranthap! that yoga was lost here for a long time."
"4.3 That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for thou art My devotee and My friend; it is the supreme secret.",That is the ancient yoga I have taught you today because you are my devotee and friend.
"4.4 Arjuna said  Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to understand that Thou taughtest this Yoga in the beginning?","4.4. Arjuna said -- you are born afterwards and Viswan is born before, so how do I know that you said (yoga) in the beginning?"
"4.5 The Blessed Lord said  Many births of Mine have passed as well as of thine, O Arjuna; I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa (scorcher of foes).","4.5. Lord said, ""Arjuna, I and you have had many births, but Parantapa, I know them all and you do not know them""."
"4.6 Though I am unborn, of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing My own Nature, I am born by My own Maya.","4.6. Although I am an immortal and immortal being and the god of the ghost, I am born of my maya, subjecting my nature to myself."
"4.7 Whenever there is decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then I manifest Myself.","4.7. O India! whenever the loss of religion and the increase of iniquity, then I manifest myself."
"4.8 For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked and for the establishment of righteousness, I am born in every age.","4.8. For the protection of the holy men, the destruction of the evildoers, and the establishment of religion, I manifest myself in every age."
"4.9 He who thus know, in their true light, My divine birth and action, having abandoned the body, is not born again, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.","4.9. O Arjuna, my birth and my work is divine, so that the man who knows the philosophy does not give up the body and attain rebirth; he attains it only to me."
"4.10 Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being.","Many men who have taken refuge in me without fear of anger and anger have attained my nature, purified by the knowledge of the Buddha."
"4.11 In whatever way men approach Me even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna.","I have mercy on those who worship me as I do; all men, in every way, follow my ways."
4.12 Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods; because success is ickly attained by men through action.,4.12. (Ordinary people) here worship gods seeking the fruits of their deeds; for men in the folk get the fruits of their deeds soon.
4.13 The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma; though I am the author thereof know Me as non-doer and immutable.,"4.13 The Chaturvaniya is created by me from the department of virtues and deeds. Though I am its maker, you know me to be unperturbed and indestructible."
"4.14 Actions do not taint Me, nor have I a desire for the fruit of actions. He who knows Me thus is not bound by actions.","I am not bound by works, nor am I bound by the fruits of works. So I know that I am not bound by works."
"4.15 Having known this, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action; therefore do thou also perform action, as did the ancients in days of yore.",For the former men also knew and did this: therefore do ye also the same things which the former men did.
"4.16 What is action? What is inaction? As to this even the wise are confused. Therefore I shall teach thee such action (the nature of action and inaction) by knowing which thou shalt be liberated from the evil (of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death).","What is deed and what is undoing? Even the wise men are misled in this. Therefore I will tell you about deed, which you will know and be free from evil."
"4.17 For verily (the true nature) of action (enjoined by the scriptures) should be known, also (that) 
of forbidden (or unlawful) action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature (path) of action.",4.17 You should know the form of the deed and you should also know the form of the deed; you should also know the form of the deed and the form of the deed.
"4.18 He who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a Yogi and performer of all actions.","4.18 The man who sees in the work of the undoing and in the work of the undoing is the wise man in the men, the yogi is the doer of all the works."
"4.19 He whose undertakings are all devoid of desires and (selfish) purposes and whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge,  him the wise call a sage.","4.19. A man whose deeds are devoid of desire and determination, whose deeds are consumed by the fire of that knowledge - form, is called a sage - jnan pandit."
"4.20 Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of the action, ever content, depending on nothing, he does not do anything though engaged in activity.","4.20. A man who is discouraged from work, constantly content and without all shelter, does nothing even if he is engaged in work."
"4.21 Without hope and with the mind and the self controlled, having abandoned all covetousness, doing mere bodily action, he incurs no sin.","4.21. A man who is hopeless and has restrained mind and soul, who has abandoned all circumstance, does not acquire sin even while doing bodily work."
"4.22 Content with what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposites and envy, even-minded in success and failure, though acting, he is not bound.","4.22. A man who is content with what he has, who is not envious of past conflicts or jealousy, who is equally capable of achieving and achieving, is not bound by his work."
"4.23 To one who is devoid of attchment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, who works for the sake of sacrifice (for the sake of God), the whole action is dissolved.","4.23. The man who is free and free, whose mind is in knowledge, all the actions of such a man who performs for the sake of sacrifice become absorbed."
4.24 Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in action.,4.24. The offering (meaning the means of offering) is Brahma and the havi (shakalya or havanable substance) is also Brahma; the havan performed by the Brahmaputra in the Brahmaputra fire is also Brahma. Thus the destination of the Samadhi-stained man in Brahmaputra Karma is also Brahma.
4.25 Some Yogies perform sacrifice to the gods alone; while others (who have realised the Self) offer the self as sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman alone.,"Some Yogis perform the Yajna of the gods, while others (Kanyaji) perform the Yajna through Yajna in the fire."
4.26 Some again offer the organ of hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses.,"4.26 Other (Yogi) Shotradics devour all the senses in a moderate manner in the fire, and other (People) Phrasaids devour the subjects in an indriyat fire."
4.27 Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath (vital energy or Prana) in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint kindled by knowledge.,4.27 The other (Yogi) purify the actions of the whole senses and souls in the self - controlled fire of knowledge.
"4.28 Others again offer wealth, austerity and Yoga as sacrifice, while the ascetics of self-restraint and rigid vows offer study of scriptures and knowledge as sacrifice.","Some are Masyagyas, Tapiyas and Yogis; and others are Swadyagyas and Yogis who fast hard."
"4.29 Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the outgoing, restraining the course of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the restraint of the breath.","4.29 Other (Yogi) who purify the air of the air and sacrifice the air of the air, by stopping the movement of the air and the air, are the same as the meaning of Pranayama."
"4.30 Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in life-breaths. All these are knowers of sacrifice, whose sins are destroyed by sacrifice.",4.30. Other regular dieters (sahadaka) purify the souls into souls. These are all the Yajna knower whose sins have been destroyed by Yajna.
"4.31 Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for the man who does not perform sacrifice; how then can he have the other, O Arjuna?","4.31 O Kurushetra! The man who experiences the remaining Amrut of Yajna obtains the Sunanat Brahma. The man without Yajna does not even get this Lok, then how will he get Parakh?"
"4.32 Thus, manifold sacrifices are spread out before Brahman (literally) at the mouth or face of Brahman). Know them all as born of action and thus knowing, thou shalt be liberated.","4.32. Many such sacrifices are spread or described in the mouths of Brahma, or Vedas. Know them all as resulting from actions; thus knowing you will be free."
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"O Parth, the knowledge is superior to the Yajna which is accomplished by the liquids. O Parth, all the works end in knowledge, that is, knowledge is their supreme."
"4.34 Know That by long prostration, by estion and by service; the wise who have realised the Truth will instruct thee in (that) knowledge.","Know it by means of prayer, questioning and service; these philosophical wise men will teach you knowledge."
"4.35 Knowing ï1thatï1 thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again get deluded like this; and by that thou shalt see all beings in thy Self and also in Me.","4.35. You will not be attracted by knowing Him again, and by Him, O Pandava, you will see the ghost in your self and in me."
"4.36 Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt verily cross all sins by the raft of knowledge.","If you are more sinful than all sinners, you will surely be swept away by the ship of knowledge."
"4.37 As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.","4.37 As the ignited fire consumes the fuel, so, O Arjuna, the knowledge - based fire consumes the entire work."
"4.38 Verily, there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga finds it in the Self in time.",There is nothing in this folk that can be as holy as knowledge. The man who is well versed in yoga himself acquires it in the soul at the proper time.
"4.39 The man who is full of faith, who is devoted to it, and who has subdued the senses obtains (this) knowledge; and having obtained the knowledge he attains at once to the supreme peace.","4.39 A man who is devout, ready and determined acquires knowledge."
"4.40 The ignorant the faithless, the doubting self goes to destruction; there is neither this world nor the other, nor happiness for the doubting.","The ignorant and the disbelieving and the doubtful man perishes, for the doubtful man it is neither the world nor the hereafter nor happiness."
"4.41 He who has renounced actions by Yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, and who is self-possessed  actions do not bind him, O Arjuna.","4.41 A self - conscious man who has done his work through yoga, whose doubts have been destroyed by knowledge, does not bind to karma, O Dhananjaya."
"4.42 Therefore with the sword of the knowledge (of the Self) cut asunder the doubt of the self born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, and take refuge in Yoga. Arise, O Arjuna.","So, India, take refuge in Yoga, by cutting off the self - questioning from the ignorance in your heart."
"5.1 Arjuna said  Renunciation of actions, O Krishna, Thou praisest, and again Yoga. Tell me conclusively that which is the better of the two.","5.1. Arjuna said, 'O Krishna, you praise the sanctity of the karmas and then the practice of yoga."
"5.2 The Blessed Lord said  Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.","Shri Bhagavan said - Karmasanayas and Karmyoga are both of the highest beneficial, but Karmasanayas is superior to Karmasanayas."
"5.3 He should be known as a perpertual Sannyasi who neither hates nor desires; for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily set free from bondage.","5.3. A man who hates no one or desires no one is always a saintly man, because, oh, woe! a man without strife is free from bondage."
"5.4 Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action or the performance of action as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one obtains the fruits of both.","5.4. The child, i.e. the people of the childhood, understands the Sanskrit and the Yogic in a different way; the man who is in any one of them in a common way receives the fruits of both."
"5.5 That place which is reached by the Sankhyas or the Jnanis is reached by the Yogis (Karma Yogis). He sees, who sees knowledge and the performance of action (Karma Yoga) as one.",5.5. The place attained by the learned is also the place of the Karmayoga. So whoever sees the number and the yoga (in a fruitful way) is the same one who sees (in fact).
"5.6 But renunciation, O mighty-armed Arjuna, is hard to attain without Yoga; the Yoga-harmonised sage ickly goes to Brahman.","But, O Mahabah, it is difficult to retire without yoga; a man who meditates on yoga soon acquires the spirit of God."
"5.7 He who is devoted to the path of action, whose mind is ite pure, who has conered the self, who has subdued his senses and who realises his Self as the Self in all beings, though acting, is not tainted.","5.7. A man who is yogic, pure in mind, possessed of body, and has experienced unity with the soul in the Jindriya and the ghostmatra is not engaged in them even in his work."
"5.8 ""I do nothing at all,"" thus would the harmonised knower of Truth think  seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing.","5.8. A philosopher will think (that is, he knows) that ""I do not do anything but see, hear, touch, smell, eat, walk, sleep, breathe""."
"5.9 Speaking, letting go, seizing, opening and closing the eyes  convinced that the senses move among the sense-objects.","5.9. Speaking, giving up, receiving and opening and closing the eyes, he is sure that all the senses are diverging in their own subjects."
"5.10 He who does actions, offering them to Brahman, and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, just as a lotus-leaf is not tainted by water.",5.10. A man who sacrifices all his deeds to Brahma and renounces asceticism is not bound to sin like a camel's leaf.
"5.11 Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body, mind, intellect, and even by the senses, for the purification of the self.","5.11. Yogis, by renouncing attachment to body, mind, mind and senses, work for self - purification."
"5.12 The united one (the well poised or the harmonised) having abandoned the fruit of action attains to the eternal peace: the non-united only (the unsteady or the unbalanced) impelled by desire, attached to the fruit, is bound.",5.12. A man who is rich obtains supreme peace by giving up the fruit of his labor; and a man who is uncommitted is bound by the fruit of his passion.
"5.13 Mentally renouncing all actions and self-controlled, the embodied one rests happily in the nine-gated city, neither acting nor causing others (body and senses) to act.","5.13. By renouncing all works with mind, the self - controlled man, who has a body, does not work or do anything while living in the city."
"5.14 Neither agency nor actions does the Lord create for the world, nor union with the fruits of actions. But it is Nature that acts.","5.14. For the people, the Lord does not create a combination of duty, or deed, or fruit of labour."
"5.15 The Lord takes neither the demerit nor even the merit of any; knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, thery beings are deluded.","The Divine Spirit does not accept sin or goodness, but ignorance is hidden from knowledge, and all living beings are enticed by it."
"5.16 But to those whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self, like the sun, knowledge reveals the Supreme (Brahman).","But to those who are destroyed by ignorance, it illuminates the soul, like the sun."
"5.17 Their intellect absorbed in That, their self being That, established in That, with That for their supreme goal, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by knowledge.","5.17. Those whose intellect is in Him, whose mind is modest, whose devotion is to Him, whose ultimate goal is to attain impenitence through knowledge, that is, they are not reborn."
"5.18 Sages look with an eal eye on a Brahmana endowed with learning and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, and even on a dog and an outcaste.","5.18 They see the same element in the Brahmins, who are rich in knowledge and wisdom, and also in the cow, elephant, swan and chandal."
5.19 Even here (in this world) birth (everything) is overcome by those whose minds rest in eality; Brahman is spotless indeed and eal; therefore they are established in Brahman.,"The heaven is won here by those whose mind is in equality; because Brahma is blameless and equal, they are therefore in Brahma."
"5.20 Resting in Brahman, with steady intellect and undeluded, the knower of Brahman neither rejoiceth on obtaining what is pleasant nor grieveth on obtaining what is unpleasant.","5.20. The man who is in the Brahma of the stable mind, the unconvinced Brahmavitth, is not happy with the receipt of the beloved object and not upset with the receipt of the unbeloved object."
5.21 With the self unattached to external contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in    the meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness.,5.21. The man with an unbounded mind in external matters attains happiness only in the soul; the man with a mind embedded in the mind of Brahma attains an endless happiness.
"5.22 The enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for they have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna; the wise man does not rejoice in them.","O countai, the pleasures which arise from the coincidence of the senses and subjects are for the sake of sorrow, for they are beginning and end. The wise man does not rejoice in them."
"5.23 He who is able, while still here (in this world) to withstand, before the liberation from the body, the impulse born out of desire and anger  he is a Yogi, he is a happy man.",A person who is able to endure the pace of action and anger before leaving the body in this society is a Yogi (competent) and a happy person.
"5.24 He who is happy within, who rejoices within, and who is illuminated within, that Yogi attains absolute freedom or Moksha, himself becoming Brahman.","5.24. The man who is content in the soul, rested in the soul and knowledgeable in the soul, becomes a Yogi Brahmaprabha and attains Brahmanevarna, or Paramomoksa."
"5.25 The sages (Rishis) obtain absolute freedom or Moksha  they whose sins have been destroyed, whose dualities (perception of dualities or experience of the pairs of opposites) are torn asunder, who are self-controlled, and intent on the welfare of all beings.","5.25. Those who receive Rishis who have been destroyed by their sins, who are undoubtedly self - controlled and will rejoice in the interests of the ghost."
"5.26 Absolute freedom (or Brahmic bliss) exists on all sides for those self-controlled ascetics who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their thoughts and who have realised the Self.","5.26 For the unworked and unwilling, conscientious and soul - conscious ones, there is everywhere a Moksha (or Brahmananda)."
"5.27 Shutting out (all) external contacts and fixing the gaze between the eyrow, ealising the outgoing and incoming breaths moving within the nostrils.",5. 27. By keeping out external objects and placing the eyes in the middle of the eyelids and by balancing the air and atmosphere scattered in the nasal cavity.
"5.28 With the senses, the mind and the intellect (ever) controlled, having liberation as his supreme goal, free from desire, fear and anger  the sage is verily liberated for ever.","A man who has a mind, mind and intelligence, free from desire, fear and anger, is always free."
"5.29 He who knows Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds and the friend of all beings, attains to peace.",I am a devotee of Yogis and Tapas and a friend of the great God and spirit of all peoples.
6.1 The Blessed Lord said  He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions  he is a Sannyasi and a Yogi; not he who is without fire and without action.,"Shri Bhagavan said - the man who does his duty without relying on his karma is a saint and a yogi, not one who has only given up fire and other actions."
"6.2 Do thou, O Arjuna, know Yoga to be that which they call renunciation; no one verily becomes a Yogi who has not renounced thoughts.","6.2. O Pandava, consider what is called Sannyas as Yoga, for no man who does not abandon his resolutions is a Yogi."
"6.3 For a sage who wishes to attain to Yoga, action is said to be the means; for the same sage who has attained to Yoga, inaction (iescence) is said to be the means.","6.3. For the Mani who wishes to be virtuous in Yoga, it is said to be to do (means) karma and for the same man who becomes virtuous in Yoga, it is said that the sham (peace, resolve) is the means."
"6.4 When a man is not attached to the sense-objects or to actions, having renounced all thoughts, then he is said to have attained to Yoga.","6.4. When the (Sadhak) is not obsessed with matters of the senses and not with deeds, the sannyasi of all resolutions is called yogarud."
"6.5 One should raise oneself by one's Self alone; let not one lower oneself; for the Self alone is the friend of oneself, and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself.",6.5. Man must save himself by himself and not fall; for the spirit is the friend of the spirit and the spirit (man himself) is the enemy of the spirit.
"6.6 The Self is the friend of the self of him by whom the self has been conered by the Self, but to the unconered self, this Self stands in the position of an enemy, like an (external) foe.","6.6. The soul of the man who has conquered the soul (indents, etc.) by the spirit is his friend, but for the unconscious the soul is like the enemy."
"6.7 The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful is balanced in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as also in honour and dishonour.","6.7. The soul that is calm in cold - heat, happiness - sorrow and humiliation is in the same state as the soul, that is, in the same state as the soul."
"6.8 The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom (of the Self), who has conered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonied (i.e., is said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi).","6.8. The Yogi who is full of knowledge and science, who is undisturbed and vital, who is like earth, stone and stone, is called possessed of the Spirit."
"6.9 He who is of the same mind to the good-hearted, friends, enemies, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful, the relatives, the righteous and the unrighteous, excels.","6.9. The man who is friendly, friend, enemy, indifferent, mediator, hater and bondman, and who is equally minded among the religious and the sinners, is superior."
"6.10 Let the Yogi try constantly to keep the mind steady, remaining in solitude, alone, with the mind and the body controlled, and free from hope and covetousness.","6.10. The Yogi, who is restrained in body and mind, should constantly establish the mind in spirit, free from the hopes and ambitions of living alone in a lonely place."
"6.11 In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of a cloth, a skin and Kusa-grass, one over the other.","6.11. By establishing his seat in a clean land, not too high or too low, with a basket, a basket and garments."
"6.12 There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and the senses controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practise Yoga for the purification of the self.","6.12. There (sitting) concentrate your mind, practice yoga for self - purification, subjecting the actions of the mind and the senses."
"6.13 Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and still, gazing at the tip of his nose, without looking around.","6.13. The head and the cervix were fixed and fixed, looking at the front of his nostrils without looking in other directions."
"6.14 Serene-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari, having controlled the mind, thinking of Me and balanced in mind, let him sit, having Me as his supreme goal.","6.14 (Sadhak) Being situated in a peaceful mind, fearless and Brahmacharya Bhattacharya, I should sit down as the ultimate goal, with the mind restrained and the mind set in me."
"6.15 Thus always keeping the mind balanced, the Yogi, with the mind controlled, attains to the peace abiding in Me, which culminates in liberation.","Thus, in my efforts to establish the mind, the Yogi of the Constrained Mind attains the ultimate Nirvana (Moksh) form of peace."
"6.16 Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is (always) awake, O Arjuna.","But, O Arjuna, this yoga is not possible for a man who eats too much or does not eat at all and who sleeps too much or is always awake."
"6.17 Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation (such 
as walking, etc.), who is moderate in exertion in actions, who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness.","6.17. Yoga is a painful thing for a man who is a well fed and well fed man, a well - exercised man and a limited sleep and wakefulness."
"6.18 When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self only, free from longing for all the objects of desires, then it is said, 'He is united'.","6.18 The time when the mind is in subjection and becomes conscious of all things, it is called the Yogi."
"6.19 As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker  to such is compared the Yogi of controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self (or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self).","6.19. As the flame of a lamp in the place of a non - pulsating air becomes unstable, so the same parable of Yotchitwala Yogik Chitri is said while practicing yoga."
"6.20 When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga attains to quietude and when seeing the Self by the self, he is satisfied in his own Self.",6.20. The state in which the mind is rested from the practice of yoga and the state in which the self is satisfied with itself by seeing itself in itself.
"6.21 When he (the Yogi) feels that Infinite Bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect and which transcends the senses, and established wherein he never moves from the Reality.","6.21. The Sukh which is extreme, attic and buddhigrahmatic, never again deviates from the state of Sukh which he experiences and in which he is situated."
"6.22 Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein estabished, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.",6.22. No other benefit comes into his mind than the benefit he receives and he is not distracted by the great pain he feels when he is in it.
"6.23 Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practised with determination and with an undesponding mind.",6.23 The dissociation from the coincidence of sorrow should be known as 'Yoga'. (The yoga which is the goal of meditation) The practice of meditation should be done with determination and without exasperation.
6.24 Abandoning without reserve all desires born of Sankalpa (thought and imagination) and completely restraining the whole group of the senses by the mind from all sides.,"6.24. By renouncing all desires arising from resolve, by ensuring the indrival community in all directions by the mind."
"6.25 Little by little let him attain to ietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything.","Shanai: By patience, wisdom, and peace, let us be able to achieve uparamata."
"6.26 From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.","6.26. Controlling the unstable mind from the causes it wanders, make it subject to the Spirit, that is, make it firm in the Spirit."
"6.27 Supreme Bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is ite peaceful, whose passion is ieted, who has become Brahman and who is free from sin.","6.27 The Yogi who is calm, sinless and whose mind is calm, in this form of Brahmaputra, receives the best happiness."
"6.28 The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of Yoga), freed from sins, easily enjoys the Infinite Bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).","Thus the sinless Yogi who does the yoga of permanently establishing the mind in the soul, enjoys the ultimate pleasure of blissful Brahmsansas."
6.29 With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.,The Yogi with a Yogious mind and a universal sympathetic mind sees the soul in all spirits and the spirit in all spirits.
"6.30 He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he never becomes separated from Me, nor do I become separated from him.","6.30. For the man who sees me everywhere and sees everyone in me, I am not destroyed (that is, I am not far away from him) and he is not condemned by me."
"6.31 He who, being established in unity, worships Me Who dwells in all beings, that Yogi abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living.","6.31. The man who worships me in the unity of all spirits, the Yogi remains in me in every way."
"6.32 He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees eality everywhere, be it pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi.","O Arjuna, a man who sees everything as equal to himself, whether it be happiness or sorrow, is considered a supreme yogi."
"6.33 Arjuna said  This Yoga of eanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance, because of the restlessness (of the mind).","6.33 - Arjuna said - O Madhusudan! This same yoga you said, I do not see its lasting state from the tangling of the mind."
"6.34 The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna: I deem it as difficult to control it as to control the wind.","6.34 For, O Krishna, this mind is of a chubby and flattering nature and strong and firm; to beg for it I consider as evil as the wind."
"6.35 The Blessed Lord said  Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained.","Shri Bhagavan says, ""Oh, my lord, the mind is bound to be conquered by a tangle and hardship; but, O Kuntiputra, it can be conquered by practice and skill""."
"6.36 I think Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self, but the self-controlled and striving one can attain to it by the (proper) means.","6.36 It is difficult to achieve yoga by a man of unconcerned mind, but it is possible to achieve yoga by means of a man of independent mind, I think."
"6.37 Arjuna said  He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, mee,t O Krishna?",6.37 Arjuna said - O Krishna! What speed does such an untiring devout man who has become minded to yoga achieve without achieving the Siddhi of yoga?
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,"O Mahabah! Is he not corrupted from both sides like a cloud of men, deceived and unsheltered in the path of Brahma?"
"6.39 This doubt of mine, O Krishna, do Thou dispel completely; because it is not possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt.","O Krishna, you are the one who is worthy to puncture my doubt, because no one else can puncture it except you."
"6.40 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none, verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief.","Shri Bhagavan said, ""O Parth, that man shall not perish in this world nor in the hereafter; O Tat, no one who does good works shall attain to Durga."
"6.41 Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there for everlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is rorn in a house of the pure and wealthy.","6.41. The Yogiburt man, having acquired the locus of the virtuous, lives there for a long time and is born in the house of the rich man, a man of pure conduct."
6.42 Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to obtain in this world.,"Or, (Sadhak) is born in the clan of the sage Yogis, but this kind of birth is undoubtedly extremely rare in this folk."
"6.43 Thee he comes in touch with the knowledge acired in his former body and strives more than before for perfection, O Arjuna.",He is full of knowledge acquired in the former body and strives even more for yoga consistency.
6.44 By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely wishes to know Yoga goes beyond the Brahmic word.,6.44 The same practice attracts him to the rest of yoga. The only curious about yoga is the transcendence of the word Brahman.
"6.45 But the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually through many births, reaches the highest goal.","But the Yogi who practices with diligence, purified from all sins and perfected through many generations (Shayna: Shanay), then attains the ultimate momentum."
"6.46 The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge (obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna.","6.46 For the Yogi is superior to the sages and is considered superior to the learned and the Yogi is superior to the practitioners, therefore, O Arjuna, be Yogi."
"6.47 And among all the Yogis he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me, worships Me is deemed by Me to be the most devout.","6.47. Among all the yogis, the devout yogis who worship me with the unity of mind in me are the most worthy of me."
"7.1 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, hear how you shall without doubt know Me fully, with the mind intent on Me, practising Yoga and taking refuge in Me.","O Parth, listen to me, you who have a weak mind and are dependent on me, practicing yoga in such a way that you will know me as a whole, without any doubt."
"7.2 I shall declare to thee in full this knowledge combined with realisation, after knowing which nothing more here remains to be known.","7.2. I will tell you in detail about this knowledge, including science, which is not known in this world."
"7.3 Among thousands of men, one perchance strives for perfection; even among those successful strivers, only one perchance knows Me in essence.","7.3. Of the thousands of men, not one man strives for perfection, and not one man among those striving seekers knows me by substance."
"7.4 Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism  thus is My Nature divided eightfold.","7.4. Earth, water, fire, air and sky and mind, intelligence and ego - this is my nature divided into eight forms."
"7.5 This is the inferior Prakriti, O mighty-armed (Arjuna); know thou as different from it My higher Prakriti (Nature), the very life-element, by which this world is upheld.","O Mahabah, this is the supernatural. Know my other living supernatural, which holds this world."
7.6 Know that these two (Natures) are the womb of all beings. So I am the source and dissolution of the whole universe.,7.6. Know that the perfect ghosts originate from these two natures. (A) I am the origin and end of the whole world.
"7.7 There is nothing whatsoever higher than Me, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as clusters of gems on a string.","O Dhananjaya, there is no other thing greater than me. It is like pearls in the whole world."
"7.8 I am the sapidity in water, O Arjuna; I am the light in the moon and the sun; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in ether and virility in men.","O Kauntyai, I am the salt of water, the moon and the sun, the light of light, the Pranava in all the Vedas, the word in the heavens, and the masculinity in men."
"7.9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the brilliance in the fire, the life in all beings, and I am the austerity in ascetics.",I am the holy smell of the earth and the brightness of the fire; I am the life of the whole spirit and the temper of the saints.
"7.10 Know Me, O Arjuna, as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intelligence of the intelligent; the splendour of the splendid objects am I.","O Parth, know me, the eternal seed of all demons; I am the wisdom of the wise, and the glory of the bright."
"7.11 Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in (all) beings, I am the desire unopposed to Dharma, O Arjuna.","O Bharat Shestha, I am the desired and the powerless of the strong and the anti - religion, i.e. the pro - work, in all spirits."
"7.12 Whatever beings (and objects) that are pure, active and inert, know that they proceed from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them.","7.12. All the satvic, rajastic and tamsical sentiments are born of me, but I am not in them, they are in me."
7.13 Deluded by these Natures (states or things) composed of the three alities of Nature all this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable.,7.13. The whole world is fascinated by these feelings (disorders) arising from the triangles. I do not know the infinite nature beyond these (qualities).
"7.14 Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, made up of the (three) alities (of Nature) is difficult to cross over; those who take refuge in Me alone, cross over this illusion.","This divine triune my Maya is a great evil, but those who come to my refuge pass through this Maya."
7.15 The evil-doers and the deluded who are the lowest of men do not seek Me; they whose knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons.,"7.15. The evildoers, the foolish, the devout do not worship Me; the knowledge acquired by Maya, they hold the Asuri spirit."
"7.16 Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna, and they are the distressed, the seekr of knowledge, the seekr of wealth and the wise, O lord of the Bharatas.","O Bharat Shastra Arjuna, four kinds of people worship me who are well - doers: artistic, curious, meaningful and wise."
"7.17 Of them the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels (is the best); for I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me.","Even among them, the wise man is superior to me, who is constant and devout, because I love the wise man and he is dear to me."
"7.18 Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in mind he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.","All these are excellent, but I think that the wise is my nature, because the stable wisdom and wisdom is well established in me in the best way."
"7.19 At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vaasudeva (the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.",At the end of many births (in a particular birth) I acquire the knowledge that 'this is all Vasudheva' and I acquire a wise devotee; such a Mahatma is extremely rare.
"7.20 Those whose wisdom has been rent away by this or that desire, go to other gods, following this or that rite, led by their own nature.","7.20. Such men, who have been given knowledge of the desire of the Bhogavas, by their nature, worship other gods in accordance with a specific rule."
7.21 Whatsoever form any devotee desires to worship with faith  that (same) faith of his I make firm and unflinching.,"7.21. Whosoever desires to worship the image of a god with reverence, I will establish his reverence for that god."
"7.22 Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that (form) and from it he obtains his desire, these being verily ordained by Me (alone).",7.22. He (the devotee) worships that god with devotion and obtains from him the desired enjoyments which I have ordained.
"7.23 Verily the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me.",But the fruit of those little wise men is wasted. The worshippers of gods are the worshippers of gods and my worshippers are the worshippers of me.
"7.24 The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My higher, immutable and most excellent nature.","7.24 The foolish man, without knowing my supreme, unconscious essence, considers me unconscious."
"7.25 I am not manifest to all (as I am) veiled by the Yoga-Maya. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable.","7.25. I am not direct to everyone who is concerned with my yoga mayas. This fascinating man does not know me as a born-again, immortal man."
"7.26 I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present and the future, but no one knows Me.","O Arjuna, I know the ghosts of the past and present and future, but I know no man."
"7.27 By the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Bharata, all beings are subject to delusion at birth, O Parantapa.","O Paranthap Bharat, from the dublishness of desire and hatred, the spirit alone attained the consciousness during the time of the origin."
"7.28 But those men of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, and who are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me, steadfast in their vows.","But the righteous men whose sins have been destroyed, are men who worship me, free and firm from contention."
"7.29 Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, realise in full ï1thatï1 Brahman, the whole knowledge of the Self and all action.","7.29 Those who surrender to me and strive to be delivered from death and death know that Brahma, the whole spirituality and the whole karma."
"7.30 Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta (pertaining to the elements), Adhidaiva (pertaining to the gods) and the Adhiyajna (pertaining to the sacrifice) know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in mind.","7.30. The men who know me, including the man who is above and above and the man who is above, the men who are above and beyond, will know me in the end."
Swami Sivananda did not comment on this sloka,8.1. Arjuna said: O Pursuthamma! What is Brahma? What is spirituality? What is karma?
"8.2 Who and how is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu (Krishna)? And how at the time of death, art Thou to be known by the self-controlled?","And, Madhu Suddhan, who is the chief here? And how is he in this body? And how are you known in the last days by men of moderation?"
"8.3 The Blessed Lord said  Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; Its essential nature is called Self-knowledge; the offering (to the gods) which causes existence and manifestation of beings and which also sustains them is called action.","8.3. Sri Lord said - the ultimate character (invincible) is the element Brahma; nature (itself) is called spirituality; the nature (knowledge, motive force) that generates the feelings of ghosts is known as karma."
"8.4 Adhibhuta (knowledge of the elements) pertains to My perishable Nature and the Purusha or the Soul is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the embodied (men).","8.4. O Arjuna, the greatest of the body - bearers, the mortal object is the supreme and the male supreme; in this body I am the ignorant."

Asceticism and unviolence in sons, wives, houses, etc. and equality in the attainment of the desired and the unwanted."
"13.11 Unswerving devotion unto Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to solitary places, distaste for the society of men.",13.11. Unconditional devotion to me by exception; lonely living and a sense of community among the (uncultured) people.
"13.12 Constancy in Self-knowledge, perception of the end of true knowledge  this is declared to be knowledge, and what is opposed to it is ignorance.","In spiritual knowledge, the philosophy of the soul, the form of permanence, or stability, is called knowledge, and the opposite is ignorance."
"13.13 I will declare that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to immortality, the beginningless supreme Brahman, called neither being nor non-being.","13.13 I will say that the conscious thing which man attains immortality by knowing is consciousness - the Anadhi, the Supreme Brahma, which can be neither true nor false."
"13.14 With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, He exists in the worlds enveloping all.","13.14. He is the hand and foot of all, the eye of all, the head and the mouth of all, the hearer of all, the one who is the universe."
"13.15 Shining by the functions of all the senses, yet without the senses; unattached, yet supporting all; devoid of alities, yet their experiencer.","13.15. He is the one who is enlightened by the virtues of all the senses, but is devoid of all the senses; he is the one who possesses all and devours virtues, even though he is without power and without virtues."
"13.16 Without and within (all) beings the unmoving and also the moving; because of Its subtlety, unknowable; and near and far away is That.",13. 16. (He is) situated within the ghost - mere; he is variable and astonished. He is unknowable by being subtle; he is distant and extremely near.
"13.17 And undivided, yet It exists as if divided in beings; It is to be known as the supporter of being; It devours and It generates.","13.17. And he is indivisible, yet he is situated like the divided in the ghosts. He is the infill, destroyer and originator of the Ghaiya Brahma ghost."
"13.18 That, the Light of all lights, is said to be beyond darkness: knowledge, the knowable and the goal of knowledge, seated in the hearts of all.",13. 18.

"13.19 Thus the field, as well as knowledge and the knowable have been briefly stated. My devotee, knowing this, enters into My Being.","13. 19. Thus, (by me) the field, knowledge and knowledge was called abbreviated. Knowing it from the essence (science) my devotee attains my form."
13.20 Know thou that Nature (matter) and the Spirit are both beginningless; and know also that all modifications and alities are born of Nature.,"You know both nature and man are eternal, and you also know that all disorders and virtues are born of nature."
"13.21 In the production of the effect and the cause, Nature (matter) is said to be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the cause.",13.21. Nature is called for the origin of action and cause and man is called for the vow of pleasure and sorrow.
13.22 The soul seated in Nature experiences the alities born of Nature; attachment to the alities is the cause of its birth in good and evil wombs.,13.22. The man in nature has the qualities of nature which are the reason for his birth in the male 's good and bad vaginas.
"13.23 The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord and the Supreme Self.","The supreme man is called in this body as Updraitya, Anumanatha, Bharta, Bhukta, Maheshvara and Paramahatma."
"13.24 He who thus knows the Spirit and Matter together with the alities, in whatever condition he may be, he is not born again.","13.24. Thus, a man who knows nature, including man and qualities, is not reborn even though he has lived (acted) in all manner."
"13.25 Some by meditation behold the Self in the self by the self, others by the Yoga of knowledge, and still others by the Yoga of action.",13. 25. Some men see the soul in the soul through the practice of meditation; others see the soul through the practice of sanksya yoga and some see the soul through the practice of sadak karmyoga.
"13.26 Others also, not knowing thus, worship, having heard of It from others; they, too, cross beyond death, regarding what they have heard as the Supreme refuge.","But others who worship without knowing it, listening to others, those who listen to others, also deserve death."
"13.27 Wherever a being is born, whether unmoving or moving, know thou, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), that it is from the union between the field and its knower.","13. 27. O Bharat Shastra! Only know that whatever static moving object is produced, it is produced by the combination of the field and the field."
"13.28 He sees, who sees the Supreme Lord, existing eally in all beings, the unperishing within the perishing.",13. 28. The man who sees the immortal God in all mortal spirits is the one who sees (in reality).
13.29 Because he who sees the same Lord eally dwelling everywhere does not destroy the Self by the self; he goes to the highest goal.,"Certainly, the man does not destroy the soul by the spirit of the same God who is everywhere equal, which gives him the ultimate speed."
"13.30 He sees, who sees that all actions are performed by Nature alone and that the Self is actionless.","13.30. The man who sees all the works done by nature and sees the soul as the maker, he sees."
"13.31 When a man sees the whole variety of beings as resting in the One, and spreading forth from That alone, he then becomes Brahman.",13. 31. This man receives Brahma when he sees the separate phases of ghosts in one (Paramath) and knows that it has expanded from him.
"13.32 Being without beginning and being devoid of (any) alities, the Supreme Self, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted.","O Kaunthai, this spirit is immortal because it is immortal and immortal. Although it is in the body, it does not work or bear fruit."
"13.33 As the all-pervading ether is not tainted, because of its subtlety, so the Self seated everywhere in the body is not tainted.","13. 33. Just as the universe is not absorbed by the microscopic nature of the sky, so the soul in the body is not absorbed everywhere."
"13.34 Just as the one sun illumines the whole world, so also the Lord of the field (Supreme Self) 
illumines the whole field, O Arjuna.","13.34 O India! Just as the sun shines on this whole people, so the same field shines on the whole region."
"13.35 They who, by the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the field and its knower and also the liberation from the Nature of being, go to the Supreme.","13.35 Thus, those who know the distinction between the field and the field specialist through the male cognition and the salvation from the disorders of nature, attain the Supreme Brahma."
"14.1 The Blessed Lord said  I will again declare (to thee) that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, having known which all the sages have gone to the supreme perfection after this life.","14.1. Shri Bhagwan said - I will repeat the best of all the knowledge, which all the people have passed through this (Lok) and have attained the ultimate Siddhi."
"14.2 They who, having taken refuge in this knowledge, have attained to unity with Me, are neither born at the time of creation nor are they disturbed at the time of dissolution.",14.2. Men who have taken refuge in this knowledge of my nature (Sardhayaam) do not be born in the beginning of creation and do not get distracted during the apocalypse.
"14.3 My womb is the great Brahma; in that I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings.","14.3. O India, my great Brahmaputra is the Yoni of the ghosts in which I conceive; it is the origin of all the ghosts."
"14.4 Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb and I am the seed-giving father.","14.4. O Kaunthai, the vagina of all the idols that are born in the vagina is the womb of Mahābrahmā and I am the father of the seed."
"14.5 Purity, passion and inertia  these alities, O Arjuna, born of Nature, bind fast in the body, the embodied, the indestructible.","14.5. O Mahabah! Sutta, Raj and Tham are the three qualities of nature which bind the body soul with the body."
"14.6 Of these, Sattva, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by attachment to happiness and by attachment to knowledge, O sinless one.","14.6. O innocent Arjuna, in these (three), the essence is pure by being manifest and anonymous (harmless, unharmful or healing); (he binds the organism) to the addiction to pleasure and to the addiction to knowledge."
"14.7 Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual enjoyment) and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action.","14.7. O Kaunthai, know Rajaguna as ragash, which gives rise to thirst and attachment. It binds the bodily soul to the attachment of works."
"14.8 But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it binds fast, O Arjuna, by heedlessness, indolence and sleep.","14.8. And O India, know that Tamoguna is born of ignorance, which seduces all the body - beings. It binds the soul by Pramad, laziness and sleep."
"14.9 Sattva attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while Tamas verily shrouding knowledge attaches to heedlessness.","14.9. O India, SattvaGuna makes happiness and Rajuguna work, but Thamoguna makes knowledge frequent and makes the soul pramaad."
"14.10 Now Sattva arises (prevails), O Arjuna, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; nor Rajas, having overpowered Sattva and Tamas; and now Tamas, having overpowered Sattva and Rajas.","14.10. O India! Sometimes the state of Suttaga is increased by overwhelming Raj and Tham, sometimes the state of Tham is increased by overwhelming Raj and Tham, and sometimes the state of Rajguni is increased by overwhelming Tham and Tham."
"14.11 When through every gate (sense) in this body, the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattva is predominant.","14.11. When the knowledge - form of light is born in the gates of this body, all the senses, then know that the Sattvaga is increased."
"14.12 Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing  these arise when Rajas is predominant, O Arjuna.","14.12. O Bharat - Shreya, when Rajogun is raised, greed, inclination, the beginning of ordinary chests, lack of shame and spira, all of these are born."
"14.13 Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusion  these arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna.","14.13. O Kurunandan, when Tamoguna is raised, there is unreason, inclination, Pramadh and Moha."
"14.14 If the embodied one meets with death when Sattva is predominant, then he attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.","14. 14. When this being (the body) receives death in the growth of the suttaga, then the Nirmala of the good doers, the heavenly worlds, is received."
"14.15 Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless.","14.15. In the period of growth of the Rajaguna, after receiving death, he is born in the Karmasakti (man) Lok and in the period of growth of the Tamaguna (at death) he is born in the Murdhayoni."
"14.16 The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattvic and pure, verily the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas.",The fruit of good works is called satvical and nirmal; the fruit of raggona is pain and the fruit of tamoguna is ignorance.
"14.17 From Sattva arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness and delusion arise from Tamas, and also ignorance.","14.17. From Sattvagaun comes knowledge. From Rajogun comes greed and from Thamogun comes Pramadh, Moh and Ignorance."
"14.18 Those who are seated in Sattva go upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards.",14.18. Men in Sattupughu go upwards (to the people); Rajas men live in the middle (manush lok) and Tamas people in the very lowest trends of Thamogun go downwards.
"14.19 When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas and knows That which is higher than they, he attains to My Being.","14.19. When the seer man sees no other than the three qualities of the doer, i.e. does not understand and knows my element beyond the three qualities, then he attains my form."
"14.20 The embodied one having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay and pain, and attains to immortality.","14.20. This body, through the origin of the male body, passes through the three qualities of birth, death, root and pain, and attains immortality."
"14.21 Arjuna said  What are the marks of him who has transcended the three alities, O Lord? What is his conduct and how does he go beyond these three alities?",14.21. Arjuna said - O Lord! What qualities does a man who has passed these three qualities possess? What kind of conduct does he have? And in what way does he pass these three qualities?
"14.22 The Blessed Lord said  When light, activity and delusion are present, he hates them not, nor does he long for them when they are absent.","14.22. Lord said, ""O Pandas! (the wise man) does not hate them when they are attracted to light, tendency and temptation, nor does he desire them when they are retired."
"14.23 He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the alities, and who, knowing that the alities are active, is self-centred and moves not.","14.23. who is as indifferent as he is and cannot be distracted by qualities and who remains in a position knowing that ""the qualities behave themselves"" and is not distracted by that position."
"14.24 Who is the same in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, stone and gold are alike, who is the same to the dear and the unfriendly, who is firm, and to whom censure and praise are as one.","14.24. who is healthy, who is united in happiness and sorrow, and who has a good eye for clay, stone and gold; such a brave man considers the beloved and the unloved as equals the reproach and the self - praise."
"14.25 Who is the same in honour and dishonour, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakings  he is said to have transcended the alities.","14.25. Such initiation which is equal in honour and disgrace, even in favour of enemy and friend, is called masculine qualitative."
"14.26 And he who serves Me with unswerving devotion, he, crossing beyond the alities, is fit for becoming Brahman.",14.26. The man who worships Me through the devotion of the unfaithful becomes a Brahma by passing these three qualities.
"14.27 For I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal and the immutable, of everlasting Dharma and of absolute bliss.","14.27. For I am the reputation of Amrut, Avya, Brahma, Eternal Religion and Unanthic, that is, Paramartha happiness."
"15.1 The Blessed Lord said  They (the wise) speak of the indestructible peepul tree having its root above and branches below, whose leaves are the metres or hymns: he who knows it is a knower of the Vedas.","15.1. Shri Bhagwan said -- (The wise man calls this world tree) the upper root and lower branch Ashvatha and Avya; whose leaves are Vedas, the one who knows such is Vedat."
"15.2 Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the Gunas; sense-objects are its buds; and below, in the world of men, stretch forth the roots, originating action.",15.2. The branches of that tree are extended upwards and downwards by virtue; (Pich) the subject is its shoots; its other roots following the works in the man - folk extend downwards.
"15.3 Its form is not perceived here as such, neither its end nor its origin, nor its foundation nor resting place: having cut asunder this firmly rooted peepul tree with the strong axe of non-attachment.","15.3. The nature of this tree as it is said is not available here, because it has no beginning and no end and no prestige."
"15.4 Then That goal should be sought for, whither having gone none returns again. I seek refuge in that Primeval Purusha Whence streamed forth the ancient activity or energy.","15.4. (Then) We should explore the position which men attained do not return to the re-world. ""I am the refuge of the first man from whom this ancient tendency is transmitted""."
"15.5 Free from pride and delusion, victorious over the evil of attachment, dwelling constantly in the Self, their desires having completely turned away, freed from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded reach the eternal goal.","15.5. Those who have retired their dignity and charm, who have conquered the stigma, who are spiritually situated, whose desires have retired and who have been freed from the conflicts called happiness - sorrow, such unconventional sages attain that unconscious position."
"15.6 Neither doth the sun illumine there nor the moon, nor the fire; having gone thither they return not; that is My supreme abode.","15.6. The sun, the moon, or the fire cannot illuminate it."
"15.7 An eternal portion of Myself having become a living soul in the world of life, draws to (itself) the (five) senses with the mind for the sixth, abiding in Nature.","15.7. In this life - society, there is a perpetual part of me that is a living being. It draws to itself the five senses and minds that are in nature (at the time of death)."
"15.8 When the Lord (as the individual soul) obtains a body and when He leaves it, He takes these and goes (with them) as the wind takes the scents from their seats (flowers, etc.).","15.8. When the God (of the body) moves (from one body), he takes these (the senses and minds) and carries them to another body as the smell carries air from the sanctuary of the breath."
"15.9 Presiding over the ear, the eye, touch, taste and smell, as well as the mind, it enjoys the objects of the senses.","15.9. (This organism) consumes subjects by sheltering these senses and minds, i.e. the ear, eye, touch, nose and nose."
"15.10 The deluded do not see Him Who departs, stays and enjoys; but they who possess the eye of knowledge behold Him.","15.10. The spirit, which is harmonized with qualities, is not seen by fools, abandoning the body, inhabiting it or experiencing it; (but) men of knowledge see it."
"15.11 The Yogins striving (for perfection) behold Him dwelling in the Self; but, the unrefined and unintelligent, even though striving, see Him not.","15.11. Yogis see the soul in their heart as they strive, whereas those with an unrealistic and unconscious mind do not see it even as they strive."
"15.12 That light which residing in the sun illumines the whole world, that which is in the moon and in the fire  know that light to be Mine.",15.12. You know the glory of the bright sun that is in the sun and illuminates the whole world and the bright moon that is in the fire.
15.13 Permeating the earth I support all beings by (My) energy; and having become the watery moon I nourish all herbs.,"15.13. I myself enter the earth and take possession of the ghost with my os and become the moon in the form of juice to nourish all the medicines, i.e. plants."
"15.14 Having become the fire Vaisvanara, I abide in the body of living beings and, associated with the Prana and the Apana, digest the fourfold food.","15.14. I myself digest four kinds of food, which are soul and apane, in the universal fire, which is in the bodies of all living beings."
"15.15 And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory and knowledge, as well as their absence. I am verily That which has to be known by all the Vedas; I am indeed the author of the Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas am I.","15.15. I am the heart of all living beings. I have memory, knowledge and knowledge. I am the only known object through all the Vedas and I am the only one who knows the Vedas and the Vedas."
"15.16 Two Purushas there are in this world, the perishable and the imperishable. All beings are 
the perishable and the Kutastha  the unchanging  is called the imperishable.","15.16. In this folk, the Ksar and the Aksar are two males, all the ghosts are the Ksar and are called the Kutastha Aksar."
"15.17 But distinct is the Supreme Purusha called the highest Self, the indestructible Lord Who, pervading the three worlds, sustains them.","But the best man is another, called the Divine Spirit, who is the invisible God who enters and holds all the three worlds."
"15.18 As I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am declared to be the highest Purusha in the world and in the Vedas.","15.18. Because I am past the QS and superior to the letters, I am known as Pursothamma in the Lok and the Vedas."
"15.19 He who, undeluded, knows Me thus as the highest Purusha, he, knowing all, worships Me with his whole being (heart), O Arjuna.","15.19. O India! Thus, whoever, without acknowledgement, knows man me manothatma, is all knowing and devote himself to me with all his heart."
"15.20 Thus, this most secret science has been taught by Me, O sinless one; on knowing this, a man becomes wise, and all his duties are accomplished, O Arjuna.","15.20. O innocent India! Thus this secret scripture is said by me, knowing it makes man wise and capable."

Shri Lord said - Abhay, purity of heart, firm position in the Jnana Yoga, charity, Dham, Yajna, Swadya, Tapas and Arjuna."

"16.4 Hypocrisy, arrogance and self-conceit, anger and also harshness and ignorance, belong to one who is born for a demoniacal state, O Partha (Arjuna).","O Parth, pride, pride, pride, anger, harsh words and ignorance are all inheritance."
"16.5 The divine nature is deemed conducive to liberation, and the demoniacal to bondage. Grieve not, O Arjuna, thou art born with divine endowments.","O Pandavas, do not grieve for the divine heritage has been granted for salvation and for the Asuri heritage bond."
"16.6 There are two types of beings in this world, the divine and the demoniacal; the divine has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the demoniacal.","O Parth, there are two kinds of ghosts in this folk, the divine and the Asuri. In them the nature of the gods is described in detail; now the nature of the Asurians is width: listen to me."
"16.7 The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity, nor right conduct nor truth is found in them.","16.7. People of a humble nature have no tendency; they have no knowledge of retirement; they have no purity, no virtue, no truth."
"16.8 They say, ""This universe is without truth, without (moral) basis, without a God, brought about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else?""","16.8. They say that this world is without shelter, false and godless, it is born of inter-sex sexual relations, and what can be the cause?"
"16.9 Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellect and fierce deeds, come forth as the enemies of the world for its destruction.","16.9. People with a low intelligence and a strong will to destroy, who adopt this vision, are born as enemies of the world (unwanted ones) to destroy it."
"16.10 Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure resolves.","16.10. These people of unclean resolutions act in the world by adopting false notions, seeking refuge in never-fulfilled desires of ambition, value and substance."
"16.11 Giving themselves over to immeasurable cares ending only with death, regarding gratification of lust as their highest aim, and feeling sure that that is all.","16.11. These Asuri people, who are suffering from endless anxieties that last until death and who consider poison consumption the ultimate goal, are convinced that ""this is it""."
"16.12 Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and anger, they strive to obtain by unlawful means hoards to wealth for sensual enjoyments.","16.12. In the grip of work and anger, bound by hundreds of hopes, they strive to accumulate unjustly wealth to satisfy their subjects."
"16.13 ""This has been gained by me today; this desire of mine I shall fuffil; this is mine and this wealth also shall be mine in future.""","16.13. I have found this today and will also obtain this manor, I have this much wealth and will have even more wealth in the future."
"16.14 ""That enemy has been slain by me; and others also I shall slay. I am the lord. I enjoy. I am perfect, powerful and happy.""","16.14. ""This enemy is killed by me and I will kill other enemies as well"", ""I am God and the Savior"", ""I am a perfect man"", ""I am strong and happy""."
"16.15 ""I am rich and born in a noble family. Who else is equal to me? I shall perform sacrifices. I shall give (charity). I shall rejoice,"" thus deluded by ignorance.","16.15. ""I was born in a wealthy and noble family. Who else is like me?"", 'I will sacrifice', 'I will give', 'I will celebrate' - they are fascinated by this kind of ignorance."
"16.16 Bewildered by many a fancy, entangled in the snare of delusion, addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall into a foul hell.","16.16 They are confused in many ways, trapped in snares and obsessions, and fall into a deep, unclean hell."
"16.17 Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices in name out of ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinances.","16.17. Those who consider themselves superior, astonished, possessed of wealth and honour, do not have the law of the law but do so by the mere nominal sacrifices."
"16.18 Given over to egoism, power, haughtiness, lust and anger, these malicious people hate Me in their own bodies and in those of others.","16.18. Selfish, forceful, mirrored, work and anger-induced, prostrating, these are haters of the self in the body and of others."
"16.19 Those cruel haters, worst among men in the world, I hurl those evil-doers into the wombs of demons only.","I repeatedly bring down such abusive, cruel and abusive people into the world, which is to say, I bring them into the world."
"16.20 Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded, birth after birth, not attaining Me, they thus fall, O Arjuna, into a condition still lower than that.",16.20. O Kaunthai! They get the assurious vagina in the birth of a foolish man and (thus) they get the untimely rate without me.
"16.21 Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the self  lust, anger and greed; therefore one should abandon these three.","16.21. Work, anger and greed are the three doors of self - destruction, so these three must be abandoned."
"16.22 A man who is liberated from these three gates to darkness, O Arjuna, practises what is good for him and thus goes to the Supreme Goal.","O Kaunthai, the man freed from these three gates of hell conducts his means of well - being and thus attains the Para - speed."
"16.23 He who, having cast aside the ordinances of the scriptures, acts under the impulse of desire, attains not perfection, nor happiness nor the Supreme Goal.","16.23. A man who abandons the law and acts only by his own desire does not attain perfection, neither happiness nor perfection."
"16.24 Therefore, let the scripture be thy authority in determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou shouldst act here in this world.","16.24. Therefore, the scriptures are proof for you in the law of duty and duty. You should know the scriptures and do your deeds."
"17.1 Arjuna said  Those who, setting aside the ordinances of the scriptures, perform sacrifice with faith, what is their condition, O Krishna? Is is Sattva, Rajas or Tamas?",17.1. Arjuna said -- O Krishna! What is the status of those who abandon the Sanskrit and worship with devotion? Is it Satviq or Rajasik or Tamasik?
"17.2 The Blessed Lord said  Threefold is the faith of the embodied, which is inherent in their nature  the Sattvic (pure), the Rajasic (passionate) and the Tamasic (dark). Do thou hear of it.","17.2. Shri Bhagwan said -- that natural (ignorant) devotion of the body - bearing men is of three kinds - satvical, rajsical and tamsical, you listen to me."
"17.3 The faith of each is in accordance with his nature, O Arjuna. The man consists of his faith; as a man's faith is, so is he.","17.3. O India, the devotion of all men is in accordance with their Sattva (nature, sacrament). This man is devout, therefore the man who is devout is the same as himself, that is, his devotion is the same as his."
